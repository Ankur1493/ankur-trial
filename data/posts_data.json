      "text": "After 3 years with AI, 100s of LinkedIn posts, and 70+ Kleo user calls… I’ve finally cracked my workflow.\n\nMost people open ChatGPT and type:\n\n“Write me a LinkedIn post on [topic].”\n\nThat’s why the output feels generic and nothing like you.\n\nThe problem isn’t AI.\nThe problem is your workflow.\n\nHere's what my workflow looks like:\n\n1. Inputs\n\nAI needs context to write in your style, about your topics, with your knowledge.\n\n- Past posts to match your style\n- Info on who you are and what you do\n- Call transcripts, SOPs, blog posts... for knowledge\n- Proven post templates for winning formats\n- Idea swipes from Reddit, X, LinkedIn, blogs...\n\n2. Chat\n\nAI rarely one-shots posts ready to publish. Instead, you chat with it and use your inputs to \"build\" the post.\n\nThink of it like Cursor for LinkedIn posts:\n\nYou don’t expect Cursor to write perfect code in one go.\n\nYou iterate with it; ask for snippets, refactors, or alternative approaches. Each step compounds until you’ve got clean, working code.\n\nDo the same with post writing:\n\n- \"What's trending on Reddit, X, LinkedIn...\"\n- \"Give me post ideas from my knowledge base\"\n- \"Give me a template for [topic]\"\n- \"Write me 5 hook variations\"\n- \"Write my post using this hook\"\n- \"Rewrite this part\"\n\n3. Publish\n\nBy now 90% of the post is done, the rest is polish.\n\n- Preview how it'll look on LinkedIn\n- Tweak the formatting for content UX\n- Add your visual\n- Schedule and post\n\nYour expertise goes in.\nAI organises and sharpens it.\nThe output feels 100% yours (only faster).\n\nThis is the exact workflow we’ve built into Kleo 2.0.\n\nI’ve also streamlined the entire process.

      "text": "In 2022, I had 0 followers and no idea how to write.\n\nI was never a fan of social media, but knew LinkedIn could change my business forever (and it did).\n\nSo I went down the rabbit hole:\n\n1. Spent $1,000s on courses and coaching \n2. Consumed (often conflicting) advice\n3. Tried every writing tool out there\n\nI met Lara along the way, and we started working towards our first 10,000 followers.\n\nBut what actually worked?\n\n- Scrolling through socials\n- Reading industry news\n- Staying on top of industry trends\n- Screenshotting posts for ideas\n- Saving content for \"knowledge\"\n\nNot just on LinkedIn, but Twitter, Reddit, and blogs too.\n\nThat became my swipe file: inspiration for topics, hooks, formats, angles, the content...\n\nThis was the biggest unlock that helped me hit 100M+ impressions and grow to 200K followers.\n\nBut I've realised:\n\nThe problem wasn't finding inspiration, it was turning inspiration into execution.\n\nAnd this is where every writing tool has failed me.\n\n- Generic templates\n- Simply recycling my old content\n- Limited databases with basic outputs\n\nNone of them could take my ideas and turn them into expert-led content that sounds like me.\n\nSo I rebuilt Kleo with Lara to solve our own problem.\n\nThe first version worked. You could see viral content instantly, but copying others isn’t a worthwhile strategy.\n\nBuilding your own voice that can scale itself is.\n\nI’m building Kleo to take ANY inspiration:\n\n- Twitter thread\n- Podcast insight\n- Client conversation\n- Random shower thought\n\nAnd turn it into posts that feel like you.\n\nIf you’re struggling to stay consistent, you’re not facing a creativity problem.\n\nYou’re facing a systems problem.\n\nKleo 2.0 is that system.\n\nTo help get you started, Lara and I have put together 101 Templates (for free): https://lnkd.in/eeUyfjtD",

      "text": "In 2023 Jake and I started posting on LinkedIn.\n\n3 years later, we built a startup (it hit $60k in 4 days).\n\nHere's what the first few years looked like:\n\n1. Started as glorified freelancers figuring it out\n2. Obsessing over LinkedIn and hooks\n3. Networking and engaging like crazy\n4. Building swipe files of posts we liked \n5. Getting inbound leads for the first time \n6. Going viral consistently\n\nBut most importantly: building profitable businesses. \n\nWhen we met making $10k/mo was a dream.\nToday our businesses have scaled beyond that.\n\nAll because of LinkedIn, truly.\n\nWe've met our best friends through this platform.\nWe've met our business partners through this platform. \n\nThis year, we became business partners ourselves.\n\nRe-building Kleo together. \n\nAnd it all started because of a simple Linkedin post.\n\nNo master plan. No idea. No experience.\n\nJust consistency, average content and a swipe file.\n\nThis is your reminder to post on Linkedin this year.\n\nYou never know, 1 post could change your life.\n\nAs a gift from me (and jake) we put together 101 Templates to get you started (for free): https://lnkd.in/em4imC7N",

Each risk made the next one possible.\n\nIf you're working on things you don't believe in: you have the power to do something that matters to you.\n\nThe jump is terrifying, but comfort will cost you more.\n\nTake the risk.\n\nMake the move.",

They're owning entire topics.\n\n7-step framework for building topical authority:\n\n1. Define your core topic domain\n\nPick a niche you can actually dominate. \"Email marketing\" is too broad. \"Email marketing for SaaS companies\" works. Most people fail here by going too wide.\n\n2. Uncover your entire topic universe\n\nMap every subtopic and user question. Use Reddit, Quora, People Also Ask, competitor analysis. You need 1,000s of keywords, not 20.\n\n3. Group keywords into content clusters\n\nUse SERP-based clustering. If two keywords show 70%+ overlap in top-ranking URLs, they belong on the same page. Pattern-based tools miss this completely.\n\nTool tip: I cluster keywords with Keyword Insights.\n\n4. Architect topic hubs\n\nCreate pillar pages for broad topics. Build cluster pages for specific subtopics. Internally link them both ways. This signals comprehensive coverage to Google.\n\n5. Execute content gap analysis\n\nFind every cluster where competitors rank, but you don't. Prioritize by search volume and difficulty. These are your highest-ROI opportunities.\n\n6. Create content with information gain\n\nAdd unique value. Original research, firsthand experience, expert analysis. AI 'consensus' content doesn't tend to build authority.\n\n7. Weave strategic internal links\n\nHub-and-spoke model. Every cluster links to its pillar. Every pillar links to all clusters. No page should be orphaned (left on its own).\n\nSites that master this see 57% faster traffic growth than those that don't (Graphite, 2024).\n\nThe question isn't whether to build topical authority.\n\nIt's whether you'll build it before your competitors do.",

      "text": "I just went on Greg Isenberg's podcast and broke down 6 proven playbooks that took bootstrapped SaaS from $0 to $300K MRR.\n\nReal examples.\nReal numbers.\nReal tactics you can copy.\n\nHere's how to get customers for your SaaS in 2026:\n\n(PS. Watch the podcast here: https://lnkd.in/e-CjhaAz)\n\nThe companies we're reverse engineering:\n\n- Kleo: $61K MRR\n- TrustMRR: $24K MRR (in 30 days)\n- Teachizy: $65K MRR\n- Tally: $338K MRR\n- LocalRank: $47K MRR\n- Mailscale: $100K+ MRR\n\nPlaybook 1: The Waitlist Strategy\n\nWe used this for Kleo. Hit $61K MRR in 53 days.\n\nThe framework: Content → Email → Webinar\n\nCreate \"edusales\" content that subtly teases your product. Don't hard sell. Lead with value. Plug your tool in ONE bullet point.\n\nLaunch beta to your waitlist with early-bird lifetime discount.\n\nWe offered the first 500 users lifetime access for $59 (normally $99).\n\nThis creates scarcity and FOMO.\n\nHit $61K MRR before even launching publicly.\n\nStack your calendar with customer calls. Use first 500 users to iterate. Then relaunch to second cohort at a higher price.\n\nPlaybook 2: The Wave Surfer Strategy\n\nTrustMR by Marc Lou: $24K MRR in 30 days.\n\nPieter Levels tweeted, complaining about fake MRR screenshots on X.\n\nMarc shipped TrustMRR within 48 hours.\n\nHe didn't use his own audience. He piggybacked on Pieter’s virality.\n\nShip fast. Quit fast if it doesn't work.\n\nBuild virality into the product. TrustMRR is inherently shareable.\n\nWhen you get massive attention but low intent, sell ads instead of subscriptions.\n\nPlaybook 3: Language Arbitrage Strategy\n\nTeachizy: $65K MRR\n\nThey took Kajabi/Teachable and made it 100% French.\n\nThat's it. Same product. Different language.\n\nSEO in other languages = marketing on easy mode. High volume. Low competition. It's what SEO in English looked like in the early 2000s.\n\nPlaybook 4: AI Search Strategy\n\nTally: $338K MRR\n\nThey became the #1 recommended form builder in ChatGPT.\n\nResult: 2,000+ new users from AI search in 2025 alone.\n\nCreated comprehensive alternatives pages and \"best of\" articles. When people search \"Typeform alternative\" in ChatGPT, Tally shows up first.\n\nTraffic from ChatGPT converts 4-5x better than Google. In some cases, 17x better.\n\nWhy? People trust ChatGPT like a friend.\n\nPlus ChatGPT gives 2-3 recommendations vs 1,000 blue links.\n\nThe next 6 months are the biggest window to take advantage of this.\n\nPlaybook 5: Signal Search Strategy\n\nLocalRank: $47K MRR. Made $5K MRR on day one.\n\nThey shipped ONE feature (a heat map) to test market response.\n\nThis let them validate demand before investing months into a full platform.\n\nThey launched it on YouTube and X (YouTube drove 80% of signups)\n\nOops, I've run out of characters.\n\nCheck out Playbook 6: High Ticket Ad Strategy (Mailscale: $100K MRR) in the comments 👇\n\nI spent 8 hours researching these SaaS strategies so you don't have to...\n\nWhich playbook do you like best?",

      "text": "This strategy got us to $62K MRR in 53 days:\n\nYesterday, my co-founder Rob gave away our entire launch playbook on Greg Isenberg's podcast.\n\n(plus 5 other playbooks, watch the full podcast here: https://lnkd.in/eKEJrwbX)\n\nHere's our Kleo launch playbook breakdown:\n\nStep 1: Content that doesn't feel like selling\n\nI call this 'edu-sales.'\n\nWe created posts that led with value first.\n\nThen we included the Kleo waitlist signup link in the posts only when it logically supported the education.\n\nMost founders scream about their product at the top of every post. We did the opposite.\n\nWe taught people how to write better LinkedIn content. Then casually mentioned how Kleo could help.\n\nStep 2: Launch to your waitlist with scarcity\n\nWe built a 20,000+ person waitlist before launch.\n\nThen we opened beta access to just 500 people at $59/mo lifetime access (normal price: $99/mo).\n\nThe constraint was real. We needed beta testers to bash bugs and validate features.\n\nBut it also created urgency because the spots were genuinely limited, the lifetime discount was real, and people moved fast.\n\nStep 3: Run webinars for fence-sitters\n\nA lot of our sales came from the email launch alone.\n\nBut some people needed more convincing.\n\nSo we ran a couple 1-hour webinars to convert the fence-sitters.\n\nThis wasn't for everyone. Just for the people on the waitlist who hadn't pulled the trigger yet.\n\nThe webinars gave us that final push to convert more people.\n\nStep 4: Talk to 50+ customers\n\nMe and my co-founders stacked our calendars with customer calls.\n\nWe learned which features people loved, where the bugs were, and what to ship next.\n\nThis wasn't optional. It was the point of this strategy.\n\nStep 5: Repeat with a second cohort\n\nSecond beta launch at $79/mo lifetime access.\n\nWe followed the same process, made more improvements, and shipped an even better product.\n\nNow we're preparing for our public launch at $99/mo.\n\nWe used this exact playbook twice:\n\n- Once for Kleo ($62K in 53 days)\n- Once for Mentions ($20K in 30 days)\n\nIt works.",

And position 1 CTR dropped by -34.5% when AI Overviews appear.\n\nPeople aren't clicking through like they used to.\n\nThey're getting answers directly from AI, and that creates a massive blind spot.\n\nYour brand could be mentioned 10,000 times in ChatGPT responses.\n\nYour product could be recommended in Claude conversations.\n\nYour company could appear in Google AI Mode answers.\n\nNone of that shows up in your traffic data.\n\nThat's why I've been building Mentions for the past few months. I needed a way to track this visibility.\n\nBecause the future of SEO isn't just ranking on Google.\n\nIt's being visible wherever people ask questions.",

It provides other useful information like titles and descriptions.\n\nConnect further data sources:\n\n- Ahrefs\n- Google Analytics\n- Google Search Console\n\n2. Enter each URL into Google Search Console or Ahrefs and find its best-ranking keywords.\n\nAdd this data to the spreadsheet for each page:\n\n- Primary keyword (your main keyword)\n- Secondary keywords (variations and similar)\n- Current position for your target keyword(s)\n\nIf a URL isn't ranking for anything?\n\nFind the most relevant keywords using Ahrefs.\n\nThen...\n\n3. Audit each blog post and assign actions:\n\n- Leave: Content that’s reached its full potential\n- Merge: Cannibalising or extremely similar content\n- Delete: Content that no longer offers value to users\n- Update: Small changes to improve the performance\n- Rewrite: Large changes to improve the performance\n\n4. Spend a few weeks in Q1 implementing these actions to get more out of your existing assets.\n\nPrioritise updates and rewrites that have:\n\n- Target keywords in positions 4-20\n- Higher conversion and $ potential\n- Easy improvement opportunities\n\nRemember:\n\nNot all of your Q1 content needs to be new. Look at your existing content first.\n\nYou're likely sitting on many quick wins.",

Convert (Top of Pyramid)\n\nHigh-intent content for people ready to buy.\n\nA. Competitor Comparisons\n↳ \"beehiiv vs Kit\"\n↳ \"Kit alternatives\"\n\nB. Product Reviews\n↳ \"beehiiv reviews\" (brand)\n↳ \"Kit review\" (competitor)\n\nC. Buyer Guides\n↳ \"Best newsletter platforms in 2025\"\n↳ \"Best newsletter tools for beginners\"\n\nD. Product Pages\n↳ \"Email newsletter software\"\n↳ \"Newsletter platform pricing\"\n\n2. Discover (Middle of Pyramid)\n\nSolution content for people exploring options.\n\nA. Solve Pain Points\n↳ \"How to start a newsletter\"\n↳ \"Newsletter best practices\"\n\nB. Case Studies\n↳ \"Email marketing case studies\"\n↳ \"How [Brand] grew to 100k subscribers\"\n\nC. Data Studies\n↳ \"Open rate benchmarks 2025\"\n↳ \"Email marketing statistics\"\n\nD. Templates and Tools\n↳ \"Newsletter templates\"\n↳ \"Email subject line generator\"\n\n3. Awareness (Bottom of Pyramid)\n\nEducational content for people learning and exploring.\n\nA. Definitions\n↳ \"What is open rate\"\n↳ \"Email deliverability explained\"\n\nB. Educational Guides\n↳ \"How to increase email open rate\"\n↳ \"How to write engaging emails\"\n\nC. Industry Trends and News\n↳ \"Gmail manage subscriptions feature\"\n↳ \"Email marketing trends 2025\"\n\nD. Ideas\n↳ \"Newsletter content ideas\"\n↳ \"Email campaign ideas for holidays\"\n\nStart at the top with Convert content. Only move to Discover once you've covered every competitor comparison, product review, and buyer guide. Then tackle Awareness last.\n\nThis framework will 10x your SEO results.",

      "text": "How I rank businesses inside LLMs:\n\nAI platforms handle millions of daily queries, Google now shows AI summaries on 1 in 5 searches, Google is making AI Mode the default.\n\nThis isn't just another SEO hype.\n\nBut successful AI SEO follows 7 key steps that most people completely miss.\n\nHere’s my AI SEO playbook:\n\nStep 1: Map your customer questions\n\nWrite down every question from your sales calls. Those same questions are being asked in ChatGPT right now.\n\nBut don't stop there. Map the follow-up questions too. LLMs love comprehensive answers.\n\nStep 2: Create answer-focused pages\n\nBuild pages that directly answer those questions. Skip the fluff and get straight to solutions.\n\nStep 3: Get authentic forum mentions\n\nMake a real account on forums like Reddit. Use your real name and company. Give genuinely helpful answers in relevant threads.\n\nAnswer long-tail questions others ignore. These feed directly into LLM responses.\n\nBut don't spam. Communities spot fake accounts instantly.\n\nStep 4: Publish YouTube videos\n\nTarget specific problems your customers face. LLMs love video citations for complex topics.\n\nFocus on topics where written content falls short.\n\nStep 5: Build strategic affiliate partnerships\n\nPartner with creators who naturally mention your solutions. Authentic recommendations carry more weight than ads.\n\nStep 6: Maximise quality citations everywhere\n\nGet mentioned in blog posts, forums, podcasts. More citations equal more LLM visibility.\n\nQuality beats quantity. One mention in a trusted source outperforms ten low-quality ones.\n\nStep 7: Track your brand mentions religiously\n\nUse a tool like Mentions to monitor when and how your brand (and each competitor) appears.\n\nThe AI revolution isn't killing SEO. It's creating new opportunities for companies willing to adapt.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nEven early-stage companies can win immediately.\n\nYou don't need domain authority like Google. You just need to get cited and you’ll start showing up.",

The correlation between AI usage and rankings was 0.011. Basically zero.\n\nThis might sound familiar.\n\nBack in April 2024, we ran a similar analysis at Byword across 5,000 sites right after Google's update that \"targeted AI content.\"\n\nSame result. AI content wasn't the problem.\n\nBut here's what everyone missed then (and what most are still missing now):\n\nThe sites that got hit weren't using AI wrong. They were doing content wrong.\n\nOur data showed sites covering random topics saw a -26.4% traffic drop. While focused sites using AI actually grew 6.2%.\n\nIt was never about the tool. It was about the strategy.\n\nThe Ahrefs study confirms it again. They found 81.9% of top-ranking pages use a mix of AI and human content.\n\nPure AI content rarely hits position one, but neither does pure human content dominate.\n\nThe pattern is clear: Google cares about quality and relevance. Not your writing process.\n\nIf you've been avoiding AI because you're scared of penalties, you've been optimising for the wrong thing.\n\nAs Ahrefs put it: \"Google probably doesn't care how you made the content. It simply cares whether searchers find it helpful.\"\n\nFocus your content. Serve your niche. Use whatever tools help you do that better.\n\nThe data's been showing this for 2 years.",

Convert (Top of Pyramid)\n\nHigh-intent content for people ready to buy.\n\nA. Competitor Comparisons\n↳ \"beehiiv vs Kit\"\n↳ \"Kit alternatives\"\n\nB. Product Reviews\n↳ \"beehiiv reviews\" (brand)\n↳ \"Kit review\" (competitor)\n\nC. Buyer Guides\n↳ \"Best newsletter platforms in 2025\"\n↳ \"Best newsletter tools for beginners\"\n\nD. Product Pages\n↳ \"Email newsletter software\"\n↳ \"Newsletter platform pricing\"\n\n2. Discover (Middle of Pyramid)\n\nSolution content for people exploring options.\n\nA. Solve Pain Points\n↳ \"How to start a newsletter\"\n↳ \"Newsletter best practises\"\n\nB. Case Studies\n↳ \"Email marketing case studies\"\n↳ \"How [Brand] grew to 100k subscribers\"\n\nC. Data Studies\n↳ \"Open rate benchmarks 2025\"\n↳ \"Email marketing statistics\"\n\nD. Templates and Tools\n↳ \"Newsletter templates\"\n↳ \"Email subject line generator\"\n\n3. Awareness (Bottom of Pyramid)\n\nEducational content for people learning and exploring.\n\nA. Definitions\n↳ \"What is open rate\"\n↳ \"Email deliverability explained\"\n\nB. Educational Guides\n↳ \"How to increase email open rate\"\n↳ \"How to write engaging emails\"\n\nC. Industry Trends and News\n↳ \"Gmail manage subscriptions feature\"\n↳ \"Email marketing trends 2025\"\n\nD. Ideas\n↳ \"Newsletter content ideas\"\n↳ \"Email campaign ideas for holidays\"\n\nStart at the top with Convert content. Only move to Discover once you've covered every competitor comparison, product review, and buyer guide. Then tackle Awareness last.\n\nThis framework will 10x your SEO results.",

Your Question\n\nUses chat history and general location for relevance.\n\n2. Decide to Search\n\nIf the model needs fresh, verifiable, or comparative info, it turns on search.\n\n3. Plan Search\n\nBreaks your ask into sub-queries, chooses a provider, sets recency or domain limits.\n\n4A. Web Retrieval\n\nHits a search index with keywords and vectors, re-ranks for relevance, freshness, and diversity, and returns candidate URLs/snippets.\n\n4B–F. Where that index comes from\n\n- Websites: Public pages and feeds\n- Collect Pages: Crawlers/APIs fetch, follow robots.txt\n- Clean & Split: Strip boilerplate; chunk with metadata\n- Index for Search: Make embeddings; add entities/links\n- Search Index: Searchable store for keyword and vector\n\n5. Open Pages\n\nFetches the chosen URLs, renders HTML, follows redirects, normalizes canonicals.\n\n6. Evidence\n\nPulls clean, cited snippets with dates and URLs; filters out duplicates.\n\n7. Write Answer\n\nComposes from the evidence; can add steps, tables, comparisons, citations.\n\n8. Quality Check\n\nGroundedness and policy screens; flags conflicting claims across sources.\n\n9. Answer\n\nFinal explanation with sources and follow-ups. Clicks and re-asks feed a small feedback loop for better routing next time.\n\nCurious to know how you show up in AI answers?\n\nUse Mentions.",

The CEO of a $3 trillion company discussing my experiment.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nNearly 2 years ago, I executed what became known as the \"SEO Heist.\"\n\nI exported a competitor's entire sitemap. Then I used AI to create 1,800 articles at scale, targeting the exact same keywords.\n\nThe result?\n\n489,509 visitors in that month alone. 3.6 million in total traffic 'stolen' from that competitor.\n\nThe post went viral. 20M+ views across all platforms. Huge publications covered it. SEO Twitter exploded.\n\nBut I never expected this.\n\nThe thing about doing public experiments is you never know where they'll land. You put something out there, and it takes on a life of its own.\n\nSuddenly you're not just a guy testing SEO tactics with AI-generated content. You're a case study in a conversation about search quality.\n\nI'm not celebrating or gloating. I'm just thinking about how weird the internet is.\n\nOne day you're a person with a laptop, a pretty crazy idea, and an AI tool that we built.\n\nAnd a few weeks later, the CEO of Google is discussing your post in an interview.\n\nThat's the world we live in now.",

And their stock fell 15% over 8 days.\n\nThe cause? Google changed a single indexing parameter that limited what LLMs could access in search results.\n\nOne technical tweak. Billions in market value gone.\n\nHere's what nobody's talking about:\n\nReddit didn't change anything. Their content is still there. Their users are still posting. Their traffic didn't collapse.\n\nBut their value to AI companies evaporated.\n\nThis reveals something critical about the new internet economy.\n\nWe're not just building on platforms anymore. We're building on whether AI models can see those platforms.\n\nReddit's entire AI strategy was based on being visible to LLMs. They signed a $60M deal with Google for AI training data.\n\nThen Google's indexing change made Reddit less accessible to ChatGPT specifically.\n\nThe market reacted like Reddit lost a major revenue stream. Because in a way, they did.\n\nThe dependency goes both ways now:\n\nCompanies depend on AI visibility the same way they used to depend on SEO.\n\nAI companies depend on access to fresh, human-generated content.\n\nWhen that connection breaks, billions disappear.\n\nHere's the irony: Reddit signed that $60M data-sharing deal with Google over a year ago. They're now in talks for deeper AI integration to funnel Google traffic into Reddit forums for content generation.\n\nThey're negotiating with the same company whose parameter change caused the damage...\n\nDid we just watch the first major AI visibility crisis play out in real time?",

      "text": "I’m seeing tons of misleading SEO advice for AI search.\n\nLet’s bust 5 of the biggest myths:\n\n1. “You need to write in a special way for LLMs to understand you”\n\nLLMs are trained on billions of examples of natural language: conversations, books, web pages, social media. They learn patterns, context, and slang the way people actually write.\n\nThat makes them robust to typos, casual grammar, and everyday phrasing. In other words: they’re built to process normal human language, not rigid SEO-style writing.\n\n2. “Adding an llms.txt file will improve visibility in AI search results”\n\nllms.txt is not a ranking factor. It’s a proposed standard for telling AI models what they can or can’t use, but most don’t even honor it.\n\nPublishing one doesn’t boost how often you show up in AI answers, visibility comes from shaping your brand narrative across sites, communities, and trusted sources, not from a text file.\n\n3. “AI will reliably use schema markup to generate answers”\n\nSchema is intended as a hint, not a guarantee. Most LLMs don’t consistently parse schema, often ignore it when conflicting content exists, or give higher weight to context from non-schema sources.\n\nPresence of schema does not assure inclusion in generated answers.\n\n4. “LLMs just pulls from the first page of Google results”\n\nAI answers don’t simply mirror the SERP. Yes, there’s overlap with the top 10 results, but it varies a lot:\n\n- Perplexity: 82% overlap\n- Google AI Mode: 35% overlap\n- ChatGPT: 28% overlap\n\nAnd beyond SERPs, 40% of AI answers come from Reddit and other community-driven sources. Meaning: ranking on page one isn’t enough, visibility in AI requires presence across forums, news, and niche sites too.\n\n5. “You need special tactics to win spots in AI Overviews”\n\nGoogle has been clear that there isn’t a hidden trick. AI Overviews rely on the same fundamentals as organic search: high-quality, relevant, authoritative content.\n\nIf your pages already perform well in traditional search, they’re eligible to be surfaced in AI Overviews. What matters is clarity, expertise, and trustworthiness, not special tactics or gimmicks.\n\nDid I miss any big myths you’ve seen?",

You can make it [really] GOOD later.\"\n\nWe could've waited another 30 days to make it \"perfect.\" But perfection doesn't exist. Feedback does.\n\nSo we're shipping it today.\n\n500 beta spots. First come, first serve. Then we close (again).\n\nJake Ward, Lara Acosta, Cameron Trew and I have spent months rebuilding Kleo from the ground up. Late nights. Brutal feedback. Scrapping features.\n\nFor context: The new Kleo is a writing workflow tool for LinkedIn. It helps you go from idea to published post in minutes.\n\nThis isn't a minor update.\n\nWe rewrote the entire core. It now handles everything from brainstorming ideas to writing with your knowledge to maintaining your voice.\n\nSome early reactions:\n\n\"You actually listened\"\n\"This is what I needed from day one\"\n\"This changes everything for my workflow\"\n\nWe're only letting 500 people in this first wave. We want to work closely with this group. Your feedback will shape what Kleo becomes for the next 100,000 users.\n\nA few hours from now, the link is going live to the waitlist. First 500 get access. Everyone else stays on the waitlist.\n\nI'll drop the waitlist link in the comments.\n\nLet's build something incredible together.",

      "text": "In 2022, I had 0 followers and no idea how to write.\n\nI was never a fan of social media, but knew LinkedIn could change my business forever (and it did).\n\nSo I went down the rabbit hole:\n\n1. Spent $1,000s on courses and coaching\n2. Consumed (often conflicting) advice\n3. Tried every writing tool out there\n\nI met Lara along the way and we started working towards our first 10,000 followers.\n\nWhat actually worked?\n\n- Scrolling through socials\n- Reading industry news\n- Staying on top of industry trends\n- Screenshotting posts for ideas\n- Saving content for \"knowledge\"\n\nNot just on LinkedIn, but Twitter, Reddit, and blogs too.\n\nThat became my swipe file: inspiration for topics, hooks, formats, angles, the content...\n\nThis was the biggest unlock that helped me hit 100M+ impressions and grow to 200K followers.\n\nBut I've realised:\n\nThe problem wasn’t finding inspiration, it was turning inspiration into execution.\n\nAnd this is where every writing tool has failed me.\n\n- Generic templates\n- Simply recycling my old content\n- Limited databases with basic outputs\n\nNone of the tools could take my ideas and turn them into expert-led content that sounds like me.\n\nSo I rebuilt Kleo with Lara to solve our own problem.\n\nThe first version worked. You could see viral content instantly, but copying others isn’t a worthwhile strategy.\n\nBuilding your own voice that can scale itself is.\n\nI’m building Kleo to take ANY inspiration:\n\n- Twitter thread\n- Podcast insight\n- Client conversation\n- Random shower thought\n\nAnd turns them into posts that feels like you.\n\nTomorrow, Kleo 2.0 launches to 500 more beta users.\n\nIf you’re struggling to stay consistent, you’re not facing a creativity problem.\n\nYou’re facing a systems problem.\n\nKleo 2.0 is that system.",

Inputs\n\nAI needs context to write in your style, about your topics, with your knowledge.\n\n- Past posts to match your style\n- Info on who you are and what you do\n- Call transcripts, SOPs, blog posts... for knowledge\n- Proven post templates for winning formats\n- Idea swipes from Reddit, X, LinkedIn, blogs...\n\n2. Chat\n\nAI rarely one-shots posts ready to publish. Instead, you chat with it and use your inputs to \"build\" the post.\n\nThink of it like Cursor for LinkedIn posts:\n\nYou don’t expect Cursor to write perfect code in one go. \n\nYou iterate with it; ask for snippets, refactors, or alternative approaches. Each step compounds until you’ve got clean, working code.\n\nDo the same with post writing:\n\n- \"What's trending on Reddit, X, LinkedIn...\"\n- \"Give me post ideas from my knowledge base\"\n- \"Give me a template for [topic]\"\n- \"Write me 5 hook variations\"\n- \"Write my post using this hook\"\n- \"Re-write this part\"\n\n3. Publish\n\nBy now 90% of the post is done, the rest is polish.\n\n- Preview how it'll look on LinkedIn\n- Tweak the formatting for content UX\n- Add your visual\n- Schedule and post\n\nYour expertise goes in.\nAI organises and sharpens it.\nThe output feels 100% yours (only faster).\n\nThis is the exact workflow I’ve built into Kleo 2.0.\n\nWe’re inviting 500 more beta users in 6 days.\n\nJoin the waitlist in the comments 👇",

      "text": "How I rank businesses inside LLMs:\n\nAI platforms handle millions of daily queries, Google now shows AI summaries on 1 in 5 searches, Google is making AI Mode the default.\n\nThis isn't just another SEO hype.\n\nBut successful AI SEO follows 7 key steps that most people completely miss.\n\nHere's my AI SEO playbook:\n\nStep 1: Map your customer questions\n\nWrite down every question from your sales calls. Those same questions are being asked in ChatGPT right now.\n\nBut don't stop there. Map the follow-up questions too. LLMs love comprehensive answers.\n\nStep 2: Create answer-focused pages\n\nBuild pages that directly answer those questions. Skip the fluff and get straight to solutions.\n\nStep 3: Get authentic forum mentions\n\nMake a real account on forums like Reddit. Use your real name and company. Give genuinely helpful answers in relevant threads.\n\nAnswer long-tail questions others ignore. These feed directly into LLM responses.\n\nBut don't spam. Communities spot fake accounts instantly.\n\nStep 4: Publish YouTube videos\n\nTarget specific problems your customers face. LLMs love video citations for complex topics.\n\nFocus on topics where written content falls short.\n\nStep 5: Build strategic affiliate partnerships\n\nPartner with creators who naturally mention your solutions. Authentic recommendations carry more weight than ads.\n\nStep 6: Maximise quality citations everywhere\n\nGet mentioned in blog posts, forums, podcasts. More citations equal more LLM visibility.\n\nQuality beats quantity. One mention in a trusted source outperforms ten low-quality ones.\n\nStep 7: Track your brand mentions religiously\n\nUse a tool like Mentions to monitor when and how your brand (and each competitor) appears.\n\nThe AI revolution isn't killing SEO. It's creating new opportunities for companies willing to adapt.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nEven early-stage companies can win immediately.\n\nYou don't need domain authority like Google. You just need to get cited and you’ll start showing up.",

Your Question\n\nUses chat history and general location for relevance.\n\n2. Decide to Search\n\nIf the model needs fresh, verifiable, or comparative info, it turns on search.\n\n3. Plan Search\n\nBreaks your ask into sub-queries, chooses a provider, sets recency or domain limits.\n\n4A. Web Retrieval\n\nHits a search index with keywords and vectors, re-ranks for relevance, freshness, and diversity, and returns candidate URLs/snippets.\n\n4B–F. Where that index comes from\n\n- Websites: Public pages and feeds\n- Collect Pages: Crawlers/APIs fetch, follow robots.txt\n- Clean & Split: Strip boilerplate; chunk with metadata\n- Index for Search: Make embeddings; add entities/links\n- Search Index: Searchable store for keyword and vector\n\n5. Open Pages\n\nFetches the chosen URLs, renders HTML, follows redirects, normalizes canonicals.\n\n6. Evidence\n\nPulls clean, cited snippets with dates and URLs; filters out duplicates.\n\n7. Write Answer\n\nComposes from the evidence; can add steps, tables, comparisons, citations.\n\n8. Quality Check\n\nGroundedness and policy screens; flags conflicting claims across sources.\n\n9. Answer\n\nFinal explanation with sources and follow-ups. Clicks and re-asks feed a small feedback loop for better routing next time.\n\nCurious to know how you show up in AI answers?\n\nUse Mentions.",

      "text": "I’m seeing tons of misleading SEO advice for AI search.\n\nLet’s bust 5 of the biggest myths:\n\n1. “You need to write in a special way for LLMs to understand you”\n\nLLMs are trained on billions of examples of natural language: conversations, books, web pages, social media. They learn patterns, context, and slang the way people actually write.\n\nThat makes them robust to typos, casual grammar, and everyday phrasing. In other words: they’re built to process normal human language, not rigid SEO-style writing.\n\n2. “Adding an llms.txt file will improve visibility in AI search results”\n\nllms.txt is not a ranking factor. It’s a proposed standard for telling AI models what they can or can’t use, but most don’t even honor it.\n\nPublishing one doesn’t boost how often you show up in AI answers, visibility comes from shaping your brand narrative across sites, communities, and trusted sources, not from a text file.\n\n3. “AI will reliably use schema markup to generate answers”\n\nSchema is intended as a hint, not a guarantee. Most LLMs don’t consistently parse schema, often ignore it when conflicting content exists, or give higher weight to context from non-schema sources.\n\nPresence of schema does not assure inclusion in generated answers.\n\n4. “LLMs just pulls from the first page of Google results”\n\nAI answers don’t simply mirror the SERP. Yes, there’s overlap with the top 10 results, but it varies a lot:\n\n- Perplexity: 82% overlap\n- Google AI Mode: 35% overlap\n- ChatGPT: 28% overlap\n\nAnd beyond SERPs, 40% of AI answers come from Reddit and other community-driven sources. Meaning: ranking on page one isn’t enough, visibility in AI requires presence across forums, news, and niche sites too.\n\n5. “You need special tactics to win spots in AI Overviews”\n\nGoogle has been clear that there isn’t a hidden trick. AI Overviews rely on the same fundamentals as organic search: high-quality, relevant, authoritative content.\n\nIf your pages already perform well in traditional search, they’re eligible to be surfaced in AI Overviews. What matters is clarity, expertise, and trustworthiness, not special tactics or gimmicks.\n\nDid I miss any big myths you’ve seen?",

Practical Guidance (28.3%)\n\nPractical Guidance has been stable YoY at ~29% of all usage. It’s the most common use case overall, and especially important outside of work.\n\nEducation is huge: ~10% of all ChatGPT conversations are tutoring/teaching.\n\nBreakdown: Tutoring/teaching (10.2%), how-to advice (8.5%), health/fitness/self-care (5.7%), creative ideation (3.9%).\n\n2. Writing (28.1%)\n\nWriting has declined in share YoY (down from 36%) but is still the dominant work-related category (40% of all work messages).\n\nTwo-thirds are about editing/modifying user text, not generating fresh content.\n\nBreakdown: Edit/critique provided text (10.6%), personal writing/communication (8.0%), translation (4.5%), argument/summary generation (3.6%), fiction (1.4%).\n\n3. Seeking Information (21.3%)\n\nThis is the fastest-growing category YoY (up from 14%).\n\nFunctions almost like web search, but with more conversational, tailored answers (e.g. fact lookups, news, product comparisons).\n\nBreakdown: Specific info (18.3%), purchasable products (2.1%), recipes (0.9%).\n\n4. Technical Help (7.5%)\n\nShare has fallen YoY (down from 12%), partly because coding queries are moving to APIs and code-specific tools.\n\nBreakdown: Programming (4.2%), math (3.0%), data analysis (0.4%).\n\n5. Multimedia (6.0%)\n\nSaw a huge spike in April 2025 when image generation was launched, then stabilized at a higher baseline.\n\nBreakdown: Create image (4.2%), analyze image (0.6%), other media (1.1%).\n\n6. Other / Unknown (4.6%)\n\nCaptures edge cases and ambiguous intent.\n\nRepresents a background share of noise and meta-queries (users asking about ChatGPT itself).\n\nBreakdown: Asking about the model (0.4%), other/unclear (4.1%).\n\n7. Self-Expression (4.3%)\n\nVery small share, despite media narratives about “AI companionship.”\n\nOther studies (like Zao-Sanders 2025) estimated companionship was the #1 AI use case, but ChatGPT’s own logs show otherwise.\n\nBreakdown: Greetings/chitchat (2.0%), relationships/personal reflection (1.9%), games/role play (0.4%).\n\nWhich use case do you use ChatGPT for the most?",

A blend of the current AI Mode and traditional Google Search together.\n\n2. Ads will be text-based like search ads and shopping ads with product details.\n\n3. Source pages before AI-generated answers.\n\n4. Web pages and ads surfaced in the middle of AI-generated answers to drive traffic to sites.\n\n5. Navigation for users who want to browse traditional Google Search results (the current default).\n\nWhat do you think about this change?",

Make as many vases as possible.\n\nGroup B was graded on quality. Make just one perfect vase.\n\nAt the end of the term, the best vases came from the quantity group.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause while one group was sketching the “perfect” vase, the other group was making, failing, learning, improving.\n\nThat’s exactly how marketing works.\n\nYou don’t find the perfect campaign in a deck.\n\nYou find it in the field.\n\nQuantity-first marketers launch campaigns, test angles, push content, run ads, gather data.\n\nEvery experiment is a “vase”. They learn fast, double down on what works, cut what doesn’t.\n\nQuality-first marketers try to build the perfect campaign before launch. Endless brainstorms, revisions, and decks.\n\nBy the time it’s live, the market has already shifted, and they’ve learned nothing in the process.\n\nThe best marketers aren’t the ones with the prettiest presentations.\n\nThey’re the ones running more experiments than everyone else.\n\nQuantity breeds quality.",

Link in comments.)\n\n1. GPT-5 isn’t built to memorize the world’s knowledge.\n\nOpenAI deliberately designed it to be a reasoning engine, a brain on top of tools. Instead of hoarding facts, it retrieves them in real time.\n\n2. Grounding is everything.\n\nNick Turley from OpenAI put it best:\n\n“The right product is LLMs connected to ground truth, and that’s why we brought search to ChatGPT and I think that makes a huge difference.”\n\nWithout grounding, GPT-5 is virtually useless.\n\n3. That is where SEO comes in.\n\nIf your content isn’t discoverable, optimized, and credible, GPT-5 (along with every other LLM) can’t use it.\n\nSEO is the oxygen. GPT-5 is the brain.\n\nThe brain (reasoning engine) can think, but without oxygen (SEO content), it can’t survive.\n\nGrounding is the lungs, pulling in air (information) in real time.\n\nBut the quality of that air depends on SEO.\n\nGPT-5 has made SEO the foundation of AI search.",

Content optimisation.\n\nHere's the background:\n\nThe client had published 300+ posts over 2 years but only hit ~1K/mo traffic (and it was falling). They’d invested 6-figures and wanted more out of what they already had.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Content audit\n\nWe analysed all 300+ posts and identified:\n\n- Nearly-ranking posts (low-hanging fruit)\n- Overlapping posts that could be merged\n- Posts with potential but poorly optimised\n- Content offering little/no value to users or Google\n- Posts targeting multiple intents that should be split\n\nWe prioritised what could move the needle fastest.\n\n2. Content optimisation\n\nWe optimised content with the most potential (~20%).\n\nFor each, we improved:\n\n- Introduction\n- Internal linking\n- SERP snippets\n- Topic coverage\n- Matching intent\n- Term frequency\n- Content structure\n\nWe completed this over a 90-day sprint.\n\nAnd hit 120K+/mo in 180 days.\n\nPublishing more isn’t always the answer.\n\nOptimising what you already have can drive bigger wins.",

Is it GEO? AEO? LEO?\n\nThen I remembered the Midwit Razor:\n\nWhat would the \"idiot\" and the \"genius\" agree on?\n\nAnswer: \"It’s just search optimization\"\n\nYes, optimizing for traditional and AI search has its differences. But in the broader picture, it’s all about showing up in front of searchers.\n\nTraditional SEO will always be the foundation.\n\nBut now it’s not IF you rank, it’s WHERE you’re showing up. Google, Bing, ChatGPT, AI Overviews, Perplexity, voice assistants, video, Amazon…\n\nWe're an industry obsessed with complexity.\n\nBlock out the noise, focus on showing up.",

Pages taken out of Google's index.\n\nIt’s probably the right call.\n\nI spent an hour searching through the indexed chats and saw that people were unknowingly sharing personal stories, medical queries, relationship advice, romantic conversations with ChatGPT, private data like API keys…\n\nFelt like digital eavesdropping.\n\nFascinating, but definitely uncomfortable.\n\nA reminder that what feels private in AI… often isn’t (and may not be in the future).",

Earned = Mentions\n\nLLMs like ChatGPT don’t pull answers out of thin air.\n\nThey generate responses by:\n\n- Running a query\n- Retrieving relevant URLs\n- Summarising from those pages\n\nIf your brand is consistently mentioned across those sources, you’re more likely to be included in the answer (even if your site isn’t the one being shown).\n\nIt’s the new version of link building.\n\nBut instead of asking:\n\n\"How do I get more backlinks?\"\n\nYou’re asking:\n\n\"How do I get mentioned in content LLMs trust?\"\n\nYou win by:\n\n1. Identifying influential source URLs\n2. Getting your brand mentioned by them\n3. Monitoring your mentions across AI results\n\nTip: Use a tool like Mentions for steps 1 and 3.\n\n2. Owned = Content\n\nThis is your own domain.\n\nWhen you optimise your site to answer specific questions clearly (using Q&A blocks, semantic HTML, topic hubs), LLMs can lift your content directly into answers.\n\nIt’s like building a mini knowledge base.\n\nBut not for people... for LLMs.\n\nEarned and owned together help you:\n\n- Influence what LLMs know about you\n- Control how you’re represented\n- Stay visible as search shifts to conversations\n\nSo the real question now is:\n\n“Are you part of the answer training set?”\n\nPS. Here's an example of earned and owned working together to help Adobe dominate LLMs:",

Peec: $100/mo\n\nAnd that’s where they start from.\n\nLLM SEO is priced for enterprises, not the rest of us.\n\nWe built Mentions to change that.\n\nFrom just $49/month, you can:\n\n- See where you show up in all LLMs\n- Track your top prompts and rankings over time\n- Understand how LLMs describe your brand\n- Benchmark visibility vs your competitors\n- Link LLM visibility to traffic and actionable insights\n\nLLM SEO shouldn’t be enterprise-only.\n\nWe’re opening up early access to the waitlist, and subscribers are getting 50% off their first month.\n\nBut we’re keeping it open for the next 7 days.\n\nJoin here: https://mentions.so",

If the positioning is clear enough. If the thing you built actually solves the problem you set out to fix.\n\nFor me, that problem started with a simple question:\n\n“Where do our clients show up in ChatGPT?”\n\nI knew my SEO rankings.\nI knew my web traffic.\n\nBut I had no clue how brands were being represented across LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity.\n\nNo rank tracking. No alerts. No visibility.\n\nAnd that felt broken.\n\nBecause more and more people are searching with LLMs instead of Google, and most brands are flying blind.\n\nSo we built Mentions.\n\nThe LLM SEO tool that helps brands:\n\n1. See where they show up in all LLMs\n2. Track their top prompts and rankings over time\n3. Understand how LLMs describe their brand\n4. Benchmark visibility vs their competitors\n5. Link LLM visibility to traffic and actionable insights\n\nAnyway, the launch is in a matter of hours.\n\nIt’ll only be available to our waitlist signups, with a huge discount (make sure you sign up).\n\nI’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built.\n\nBut it’s still a weird feeling. Building something quietly for months, then suddenly it’s real.\n\nNot perfect. Not finished. But real.\n\nJoin the waitlist: https://mentions.so/",

And building.\n\nUntil (in my humble opinion) we built the best product available on the market.\n\nNot only can you track your visibility across ALL LLMs like ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Claude, even Grok...\n\nYou can:\n\n- Track sentiment\n- See the exact LLM answers\n- Compare vs your competitors\n- Get website traffic data from LLMs\n- Action our tailored 'Insights' to improve visibility\n\nAnd we're launching it within the next 48 hours at a fraction of the cost of other tools on the market.\n\nBUT only to a closed group of users.

Team, sales, calls, marketing, operations…\n\nBut I realised I suck at 90% of those things.\n\nI’m not an operator, builder, or salesperson.\n\nWhat I’m actually good at? Ideas and getting customers.\n\nNow I’m ONLY running the Byword playbook.\n\nNo fluff. No office. No big team.\nJust me, executors, and a clear plan.\n\nHere’s exactly what I’m working on:\n\n1. Mentions.so\n\nLLM SEO is the new SEO.\n\nTrack visibility, understand sentiment, compare vs competitors, and get insights to improve rankings in LLMs like ChatGPT.\n\nLaunching next week to 2,500+ waitlist users.\n\n2. Kleo.so\n\nKleo 1.0 is gone.\n\nLinkedIn told us the Chrome extension could no longer exist for our 70,000+ users. So we had to pivot.\n\nKleo 2.0 is a top LinkedIn ghostwriter in your pocket.\n\nLaunching on 22nd July to 10,000+ waitlist users.\n\n3. ContactLocal.so\n\nLocal SEO is the most stable aspect of SEO\n\nWe’ve delivered incredible (and relatively fast) results for local businesses over the last 6 years.\n\nSo, we’re doubling down on local SEO:\n\nContact Local is the new arm of Contact.so.\n\nYes, they’re all early.\n\nBut in 90 days, my goal is $1M ARR.\n\nWe’re 16 days in and close to launching.\n\nI’m sharing the whole process as I go on X (@jakezward) and bi-weekly updates here on LinkedIn.\n\nFollow along as I \"market in public\".",

What about Vibe SEO?\n\nVibe coding turns dev cycles from weeks to hours using tools like Cursor, Replit, and Lovable.\n\nVibe marketing turns smart marketers with the right tools into a 10x marketing team.\n\nVibe SEO turns SEOs into a full team, using instinct and automation to win search presence faster than ever.\n\n6 ways Vibe SEO is already happening:\n\n1. Using instinct to capitalise on search trends before keyword research tools pick them up.\n\nE.g. Creating a \"[Tool] Alternatives\" page within 24 hours of a competitor's Product Hunt launch.\n\n2. Using automation to execute at scale.\n\nE.g. Generating 200 blog posts with Byword.ai based on competitors' sitemaps or keyword frameworks.\n\n3. Repurposing content across channels.\n\nE.g. Building an AI agent that turns LinkedIn, X, or YouTube content into blog posts.\n\n4. Spinning up SEO/linkable assets quickly.\n\nE.g. Using Cursor or Lovable to launch a free tool for lead generation without a developer.\n\n5. Capturing search presence across platforms.\n\nE.g. Building an AI agent that turns content into Reddit answers or LinkedIn Pulse/Medium articles.\n\n6. Winning brand mentions that LLMs actually cite.\n\nE.g. Exporting most frequent citations from Mentions.so and automating the outreach to get your brand included.\n\nSEO isn’t slow anymore.\n\nIntuition, automation, tools, and speed are outpacing teams, budgets, and wait times.\n\nThose who adapt will dominate the new search wave.",

But...\n\nKleo isn't going anywhere.\n\nAfter 2 years and 70,000+ users, the Kleo Chrome extension has to shut down. LinkedIn told us to.\n\nIt's a sad day for me.\n\nI created Kleo with one goal:\n\nMake content ideation quicker, easier and enjoyable.\n\nI built and used it myself for 10 months before sharing it with anyone else. And I grew to 100,000+ followers.\n\nKleo helped me get the best ideas and 10x my writing.\n\nThen in 2023, I launched it to the public. And it's since helped 10,000s of creators achieve the same.\n\nBut LinkedIn came knocking, and we have to comply.\n\nSo as of today, the Kleo Chrome extension is gone.\n\nHowever…\n\nThis isn’t a shutdown. It’s the evolution we’ve been planning for. The one tool that will outperform everything else on the market.\n\nIt just came a little earlier than expected.\n\nWe’ve been building Kleo 2.0 to be the best.\n\n- Powerful\n- ⁠Compliant\n- Future-proof\n\nAnd in doing so, we’ve unlocked features that weren’t previously possible.\n\nBut Kleo 2.0 isn’t just a new product.\n\nWe’re also bringing in new people to help us build THE best tool on the market…\n\nLike the one and only: Lara Acosta.\n\nSo don’t go anywhere. This is just the beginning.\n\nPS. Get launch day notifications: https://kleo.so/",

Analyse your strengths/interests and work on them. It could be building some great product from scratch OR just your CP ratings OR anything else you like! As long as it helps you stand out and get the required visibility it wouldn't be too hard to get interview calls. \n\n2. Decent understanding of CI/CD pipeline and basic infra setups, You do NOT need to understand every single product being provided by every cloud provider, but having an understanding of the overall workflow and some off the shelf solutions would help you be a better engineer. \n\n3. CS fundamentals: In all this DSA vs Dev debate we are somehow forgetting CS fundamentals, which in my opinion are more important than learning some framework and is a more transferrable skill.\n\n4. CGPA: Maintain a decent grade, it helps you get shortlisted for a lot of opportunities.\n\n5. Use Social Media platforms wisely: Use platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter wisely! You could showcase your talent on these platforms and get the required visibility (rather than doomscrolling and wasting your day).\n\nHope posts like these are helpful, as I don't find value in posting \"day in the life of an engineer\" sort of content. Would appreciate if folks here could help me with topics I could write on.",

Are they hiring for roles that signal a gap? Have they recently raised funding?\n 💬 Reach out with relevant messaging (aka not “Just following up”)\n 📅 Book more meetings with people who actually want to talk\n\nOutbound is way easier when you start with intent and layer on smart account research. \n\nFollow the signals, not the spreadsheets.\n\nWhat’s your #1 outbound struggle right now?

When a program runs, it becomes a process.\n\nA process can be broken down in more than 1 independent tasks mostly, these smaller tasks are referred as threads\nMultiple threads can share the same memory space and resources of the process, allowing for parallel execution of tasks.\n\nProcesses are isolated, whereas threads within the same process can communicate directly with each other, sharing data and resources.\n\nThat’s all from my side.

Kernel is used for these things like interaction with an hardware, file, memory and process management.\nKernel is also referred as heart of OS\n\nWhen any application needs to use hardware, or kernel space, the application/user mode uses a system call, which shifts the control to kernel and after processing the request the control shift backs to user mode\n\nThat’s all from my side.

      "text": "How does Docker work internally? Let's dive into the mechanism that happens when you use Docker. \n\nStarting with the registry part: there are applications online that create an image of their system and push it out to platforms like Docker Hub. It's similar to how we put our code on GitHub.\n\nThese registries are used to grab those images. Both the Docker host and client are inside your Linux machine. Let’s say you type the command docker run mongo. What happens next?\n\nThe client (your terminal) sends a request to the Docker host (Docker Engine) to run MongoDB. If the image isn't found locally, the daemon grabs that image from Docker Hub if it’s available there.\n\nAfter grabbing the image, Docker Engine will start a container running MongoDB.\n\nYou may not know the proper difference between images and containers, so here's an article -- https://lnkd.in/giHZ7pvx",

With more digging, I came across Socket.IO and decided to learn it.\n\nSocket.IO Resources I Followed:\n - Socket.IO docs\n - @piyushgarg195 video\n\nAfter this, I created a chat application: https://lnkd.in/gq6BYMAS\n\nI also used Redis for the pub/sub model in this project, but I’ll cover that in another post.\n\nSo, I thought I had learned everything about WebSockets, right? Well, not quite. A few days later, I joined 1-100xDevs by Harkirat Singh and in the first lecture, I learned that Socket.IO is not necessarily the best way to use WebSockets. So, if it’s not the best, what is?\n\nIn the Week 19 lectures, I learned that we should use WebSockets directly instead of relying on Socket.IO.\n\nAfter these lectures, I learned about the ws library and got to apply these concepts in a project for an intern assignment from optionolgy. You can check out my project here: https://lnkd.in/gJvnNQqx\n\nThat’s all from my side. Thanks for your interest and time.\n\nIf you read till here, a like ❤️ and follow would be great 😃.",

      "text": "When considering SQL versus NoSQL databases, it's vital to grasp their fundamental differences:\n\nSQL databases organize data into structured tables with rows and columns, following a relational model.\nIn contrast, NoSQL databases offer diverse formats such as document-based storage in MongoDB or key-value pairs in Redis.\n\n\nNoSQL databases employ query languages or APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.\nSQL databases, conversely, utilize SQL commands for querying and managing data.\n\nHorizontal scaling is favored and more straightforward in NoSQL databases, allowing for seamless distribution of data across multiple servers.\nVertical scaling, on the other hand, is typically associated with SQL databases. However, achieving horizontal scaling in SQL databases can be challenging due to the stringent ACID properties.\n\nThese considerations play a crucial role in selecting the appropriate database for your project.",
