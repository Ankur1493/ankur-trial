      "text": "Flew to London for a single meeting that will define our next 90 days at Kleo. Last quarter, we hit $62k MRR in 53 days. Here's the exact agenda:\n\n[Total time: 6-8 hours]\n\nFOUNDATIONS (30 mins)\n\nEveryone shares one thing they need from today. (5 mins)\n\nAdd issues to the list. \"Issues\" are tasks, blockers, or opportunities that need attention this year. (10 mins)\n\nROCK SETTING (4.5 hours)\n\nPut 1-year goals on the whiteboard (revenue, profit, client numbers)\n\nPut 90-day goals next to them. Only topline numbers first.\n\nThen brainstorm: \"How do we hit these numbers?\"\n\nChoose the most important \"issues\" to prioritize over the next 90 days.\n\nKeep, Kill, Combine until you have an organized list.\n\nLUNCH BREAK\n\nChoose 3-7 Company Rocks. Rocks must be SMART goals.\n\nThen choose Rocks for each department and each leadership team member.\n\nFinal Rock count:\n\n- Company: 3–7 Rocks\n- Departments: 3–7 Rocks each\n- Leadership: 3–7 Rocks each\n- Other Employees: 1–3 Rocks each\n\nShare Rocks in a circle.\n\nHold each other accountable using two thumbs up: one for SMART, one to confirm it's right-for-this-quarter.\n\nIDS SECTION (2 hours)\n\nIDS = Issues to Discuss and Solve\n\nReview your issues list. Pick the top 3.\n\nIdentify, Discuss, Solve. Leave with problems solved to build momentum.\n\nCLOSING (30 mins)\n\nPut on calming music. Get into a meditative state.\n\nAnswer these four questions:\n\n- How did you feel about today?\n- Any AHAs or highlights?\n- Were your expectations met?\n- Rate this meeting 1-10\n\nThis framework keeps us aligned, focused, and moving fast.\n\nWe’re launching Kleo to the public in 15 days.\n\nAnd we want you to be part of it.\n\nTo celebrate, we’re holding a webinar to reveal the entire lead gen system we used with organic content to scale our businesses from 0 to $61k MRR in 53 days.\n\nRSVP here for free: https://lnkd.in/eJTyrHjn",

      "text": "Google's leaked documents confirmed it.\n\nThey use a secret metric called siteAuthority to determine who to trust.\n\nThe sites dominating search in 2025 and beyond aren't chasing keywords. They're owning entire topics.\n\n7-step framework for building topical authority:\n\n1. Define your core topic domain\n\nPick a niche you can actually dominate. \"Email marketing\" is too broad. \"Email marketing for SaaS companies\" works. Most people fail here by going too wide.\n\n2. Uncover your entire topic universe\n\nMap every subtopic and user question. Use Reddit, Quora, People Also Ask, competitor analysis. You need 1,000s of keywords, not 20.\n\n3. Group keywords into content clusters\n\nUse SERP-based clustering. If two keywords show 70%+ overlap in top-ranking URLs, they belong on the same page. Pattern-based tools miss this completely.\n\nTool tip: I cluster keywords with Keyword Insights.\n\n4. Architect topic hubs\n\nCreate pillar pages for broad topics. Build cluster pages for specific subtopics. Internally link them both ways. This signals comprehensive coverage to Google.\n\n5. Execute content gap analysis\n\nFind every cluster where competitors rank, but you don't. Prioritize by search volume and difficulty. These are your highest-ROI opportunities.\n\n6. Create content with information gain\n\nAdd unique value. Original research, firsthand experience, expert analysis. AI 'consensus' content doesn't tend to build authority.\n\n7. Weave strategic internal links\n\nHub-and-spoke model. Every cluster links to its pillar. Every pillar links to all clusters. No page should be orphaned (left on its own).\n\nSites that master this see 57% faster traffic growth than those that don't (Graphite, 2024).\n\nThe question isn't whether to build topical authority.\n\nIt's whether you'll build it before your competitors do.",

Plug your tool in ONE bullet point.\n\nLaunch beta to your waitlist with early-bird lifetime discount.\n\nWe offered the first 500 users lifetime access for $59 (normally $99).\n\nThis creates scarcity and FOMO.\n\nHit $61K MRR before even launching publicly.\n\nStack your calendar with customer calls. Use first 500 users to iterate. Then relaunch to second cohort at a higher price.\n\nPlaybook 2: The Wave Surfer Strategy\n\nTrustMR by Marc Lou: $24K MRR in 30 days.\n\nPieter Levels tweeted, complaining about fake MRR screenshots on X.\n\nMarc shipped TrustMRR within 48 hours.\n\nHe didn't use his own audience. He piggybacked on Pieter’s virality.\n\nShip fast. Quit fast if it doesn't work.\n\nBuild virality into the product. TrustMRR is inherently shareable.\n\nWhen you get massive attention but low intent, sell ads instead of subscriptions.\n\nPlaybook 3: Language Arbitrage Strategy\n\nTeachizy: $65K MRR\n\nThey took Kajabi/Teachable and made it 100% French.\n\nThat's it. Same product. Different language.\n\nSEO in other languages = marketing on easy mode. High volume. Low competition. It's what SEO in English looked like in the early 2000s.\n\nPlaybook 4: AI Search Strategy\n\nTally: $338K MRR\n\nThey became the #1 recommended form builder in ChatGPT.\n\nResult: 2,000+ new users from AI search in 2025 alone.\n\nCreated comprehensive alternatives pages and \"best of\" articles. When people search \"Typeform alternative\" in ChatGPT, Tally shows up first.\n\nTraffic from ChatGPT converts 4-5x better than Google. In some cases, 17x better.\n\nWhy? People trust ChatGPT like a friend.\n\nPlus ChatGPT gives 2-3 recommendations vs 1,000 blue links.\n\nThe next 6 months are the biggest window to take advantage of this.\n\nPlaybook 5: Signal Search Strategy\n\nLocalRank: $47K MRR. Made $5K MRR on day one.\n\nThey shipped ONE feature (a heat map) to test market response.\n\nThis let them validate demand before investing months into a full platform.\n\nThey launched it on YouTube and X (YouTube drove 80% of signups)\n\nOops, I've run out of characters.\n\nCheck out Playbook 6: High Ticket Ad Strategy (Mailscale: $100K MRR) in the comments 👇\n\nI spent 8 hours researching these SaaS strategies so you don't have to...\n\nWhich playbook do you like best?",

Convert (Top of Pyramid)\n\nHigh-intent content for people ready to buy.\n\nA. Competitor Comparisons\n↳ \"beehiiv vs Kit\"\n↳ \"Kit alternatives\"\n\nB. Product Reviews\n↳ \"beehiiv reviews\" (brand)\n↳ \"Kit review\" (competitor)\n\nC. Buyer Guides\n↳ \"Best newsletter platforms in 2025\"\n↳ \"Best newsletter tools for beginners\"\n\nD. Product Pages\n↳ \"Email newsletter software\"\n↳ \"Newsletter platform pricing\"\n\n2. Discover (Middle of Pyramid)\n\nSolution content for people exploring options.\n\nA. Solve Pain Points\n↳ \"How to start a newsletter\"\n↳ \"Newsletter best practices\"\n\nB. Case Studies\n↳ \"Email marketing case studies\"\n↳ \"How [Brand] grew to 100k subscribers\"\n\nC. Data Studies\n↳ \"Open rate benchmarks 2025\"\n↳ \"Email marketing statistics\"\n\nD. Templates and Tools\n↳ \"Newsletter templates\"\n↳ \"Email subject line generator\"\n\n3. Awareness (Bottom of Pyramid)\n\nEducational content for people learning and exploring.\n\nA. Definitions\n↳ \"What is open rate\"\n↳ \"Email deliverability explained\"\n\nB.

      "text": "How I rank businesses inside LLMs:\n\nAI platforms handle millions of daily queries, Google now shows AI summaries on 1 in 5 searches, Google is making AI Mode the default.\n\nThis isn't just another SEO hype.\n\nBut successful AI SEO follows 7 key steps that most people completely miss.\n\nHere’s my AI SEO playbook:\n\nStep 1: Map your customer questions\n\nWrite down every question from your sales calls. Those same questions are being asked in ChatGPT right now.\n\nBut don't stop there. Map the follow-up questions too. LLMs love comprehensive answers.\n\nStep 2: Create answer-focused pages\n\nBuild pages that directly answer those questions. Skip the fluff and get straight to solutions.\n\nStep 3: Get authentic forum mentions\n\nMake a real account on forums like Reddit. Use your real name and company. Give genuinely helpful answers in relevant threads.\n\nAnswer long-tail questions others ignore. These feed directly into LLM responses.\n\nBut don't spam. Communities spot fake accounts instantly.\n\nStep 4: Publish YouTube videos\n\nTarget specific problems your customers face. LLMs love video citations for complex topics.\n\nFocus on topics where written content falls short.\n\nStep 5: Build strategic affiliate partnerships\n\nPartner with creators who naturally mention your solutions. Authentic recommendations carry more weight than ads.\n\nStep 6: Maximise quality citations everywhere\n\nGet mentioned in blog posts, forums, podcasts. More citations equal more LLM visibility.\n\nQuality beats quantity. One mention in a trusted source outperforms ten low-quality ones.\n\nStep 7: Track your brand mentions religiously\n\nUse a tool like Mentions to monitor when and how your brand (and each competitor) appears.\n\nThe AI revolution isn't killing SEO. It's creating new opportunities for companies willing to adapt.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nEven early-stage companies can win immediately.\n\nYou don't need domain authority like Google. You just need to get cited and you’ll start showing up.",

Plan Search\n\nBreaks your ask into sub-queries, chooses a provider, sets recency or domain limits.\n\n4A. Web Retrieval\n\nHits a search index with keywords and vectors, re-ranks for relevance, freshness, and diversity, and returns candidate URLs/snippets.\n\n4B–F. Where that index comes from\n\n- Websites: Public pages and feeds\n- Collect Pages: Crawlers/APIs fetch, follow robots.txt\n- Clean & Split: Strip boilerplate; chunk with metadata\n- Index for Search: Make embeddings; add entities/links\n- Search Index: Searchable store for keyword and vector\n\n5. Open Pages\n\nFetches the chosen URLs, renders HTML, follows redirects, normalizes canonicals.\n\n6. Evidence\n\nPulls clean, cited snippets with dates and URLs; filters out duplicates.\n\n7. Write Answer\n\nComposes from the evidence; can add steps, tables, comparisons, citations.\n\n8. Quality Check\n\nGroundedness and policy screens; flags conflicting claims across sources.\n\n9.

      "text": "I’m seeing tons of misleading SEO advice for AI search.\n\nLet’s bust 5 of the biggest myths:\n\n1. “You need to write in a special way for LLMs to understand you”\n\nLLMs are trained on billions of examples of natural language: conversations, books, web pages, social media. They learn patterns, context, and slang the way people actually write.\n\nThat makes them robust to typos, casual grammar, and everyday phrasing. In other words: they’re built to process normal human language, not rigid SEO-style writing.\n\n2. “Adding an llms.txt file will improve visibility in AI search results”\n\nllms.txt is not a ranking factor. It’s a proposed standard for telling AI models what they can or can’t use, but most don’t even honor it.\n\nPublishing one doesn’t boost how often you show up in AI answers, visibility comes from shaping your brand narrative across sites, communities, and trusted sources, not from a text file.\n\n3. “AI will reliably use schema markup to generate answers”\n\nSchema is intended as a hint, not a guarantee. Most LLMs don’t consistently parse schema, often ignore it when conflicting content exists, or give higher weight to context from non-schema sources.\n\nPresence of schema does not assure inclusion in generated answers.\n\n4. “LLMs just pulls from the first page of Google results”\n\nAI answers don’t simply mirror the SERP. Yes, there’s overlap with the top 10 results, but it varies a lot:\n\n- Perplexity: 82% overlap\n- Google AI Mode: 35% overlap\n- ChatGPT: 28% overlap\n\nAnd beyond SERPs, 40% of AI answers come from Reddit and other community-driven sources. Meaning: ranking on page one isn’t enough, visibility in AI requires presence across forums, news, and niche sites too.\n\n5. “You need special tactics to win spots in AI Overviews”\n\nGoogle has been clear that there isn’t a hidden trick. AI Overviews rely on the same fundamentals as organic search: high-quality, relevant, authoritative content.\n\nIf your pages already perform well in traditional search, they’re eligible to be surfaced in AI Overviews. What matters is clarity, expertise, and trustworthiness, not special tactics or gimmicks.\n\nDid I miss any big myths you’ve seen?",

You can make it [really] GOOD later.\"\n\nWe could've waited another 30 days to make it \"perfect.\" But perfection doesn't exist. Feedback does.\n\nSo we're shipping it today.\n\n500 beta spots. First come, first serve. Then we close (again).\n\nJake Ward, Lara Acosta, Cameron Trew and I have spent months rebuilding Kleo from the ground up. Late nights. Brutal feedback. Scrapping features.\n\nFor context: The new Kleo is a writing workflow tool for LinkedIn. It helps you go from idea to published post in minutes.\n\nThis isn't a minor update.\n\nWe rewrote the entire core. It now handles everything from brainstorming ideas to writing with your knowledge to maintaining your voice.\n\nSome early reactions:\n\n\"You actually listened\"\n\"This is what I needed from day one\"\n\"This changes everything for my workflow\"\n\nWe're only letting 500 people in this first wave. We want to work closely with this group. Your feedback will shape what Kleo becomes for the next 100,000 users.\n\nA few hours from now, the link is going live to the waitlist. First 500 get access. Everyone else stays on the waitlist.\n\nI'll drop the waitlist link in the comments.\n\nLet's build something incredible together.",

A blend of the current AI Mode and traditional Google Search together.\n2. Ads will be text-based, like search ads and shopping ads with product details.\n3. Source pages before AI-generated answers.\n4. Web pages and ads surfaced in the middle of AI-generated answers to drive traffic to sites.\n5. Navigation for users who want to browse traditional Google Search results (the current default).\n\nWhat do you think about this change?",

      "text": "Our bootstrapped SaaS crossed $19,055 MRR in 30 days with a 3-man team, 2 social accounts, zero ads and no cold outreach.\n\nHere’s the entire playbook (with videos):\n\n1. Build your waitlist before the product\n\nWe built our waitlist for 6 weeks before launch and convinced 3,500 people to sign up.\n\nWhen we launched, we offered 50% off for one week only, and made the tool payable from day 1 with no free trial.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eMbU2_k3\n\n2. Product placement > Product promotion\n\nWe publish content on LinkedIn and X, but we don't “shill” the product.\n\nWe write helpful posts about AI SEO that have viral potential and casually mention our SaaS in an organic way (bypassing people's aversion to being sold to).\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eyNz4US2\n\n3. Great co-founders make or break a project\n\nTo succeed, you need to build, sell, and operate: doing 1/3 well is hard, doing all 3 alone is nearly impossible.\n\nSolopreneurship is a myth. Everyone needs help, and I owe the success of Mentions to Jake Ward.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ejvfyztB\n\n4. Ride the wave, don’t create it\n\nAI SEO is trending. Everyone’s wondering how to get their brand to show up in ChatGPT.\n\nWe didn’t try to create a new category. We surfed a wave that was already rolling to shore, and that tailwind made growth 100x easier.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/enXBc9Xu\n\n5. Positioning is power\n\nOur competitors are public companies and can outspend us on dev resources, but we're bootstrapped. We can listen to customers while competitors are slaves to their board.\n\nTurn your competitor’s strength into their weakness.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/exRQdVbH\n\n6. Customer service = Leverage\n\nWe have 250+ customers, most have my personal cell number. They call me and I pick up.\n\nIn the AI era, 90% of code is commoditized, but you can provide 100x better customer service than your competitor (there’s so much alpha in CS and no one's paying attention).\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/etMsaG-m\n\n7. Customer conversations > Roadmap\n\nWe've done 50+ customer interviews and learned things that caused us to pivot our entire product/positioning.\n\nYou don't need a roadmap. You don't need a brilliant idea. As Jason M. Lemkin says, “You just need to do your 50 customer interviews”.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ejT82JSc\n\nOops, I've run out of words...\n\nYou can see the breakdowns for 8, 9 and 10 in the comments 👇",

Link in comments.)\n\n1. GPT-5 isn’t built to memorize the world’s knowledge.\n\nOpenAI deliberately designed it to be a reasoning engine, a brain on top of tools. Instead of hoarding facts, it retrieves them in real time.\n\n2. Grounding is everything.\n\nNick Turley from OpenAI put it best:\n\n“The right product is LLMs connected to ground truth, and that’s why we brought search to ChatGPT and I think that makes a huge difference.”\n\nWithout grounding, GPT-5 is virtually useless.\n\n3. That is where SEO comes in.\n\nIf your content isn’t discoverable, optimized, and credible, GPT-5 (along with every other LLM) can’t use it.\n\nSEO is the oxygen. GPT-5 is the brain.\n\nThe brain (reasoning engine) can think, but without oxygen (SEO content), it can’t survive.\n\nGrounding is the lungs, pulling in air (information) in real time.\n\nBut the quality of that air depends on SEO.\n\nGPT-5 has made SEO the foundation of AI search.",

Content audit\n\nWe analyzed all 300+ posts and identified:\n\n- Nearly-ranking posts (low-hanging fruit)\n- Overlapping posts that could be merged\n- Posts with potential but poorly optimized\n- Content offering little/no value to users or Google\n- Posts targeting multiple intents that should be split\n\nWe prioritized what could move the needle fastest.\n\n2. Content optimization\n\nWe optimized content with the most potential (~20%).\n\nFor each, we improved:\n\n- Introduction\n- Internal linking\n- SERP snippets\n- Topic coverage\n- Matching intent\n- Term frequency\n- Content structure\n\nWe completed this over a 90-day sprint.\n\nAnd hit 120K+/mo in 180 days.\n\nPublishing more isn’t always the answer.\n\nOptimizing what you already have can drive bigger wins.",

But in the broader picture, it’s all about showing up in front of searchers.\n\nTraditional SEO will always be the foundation.\n\nBut now it’s not IF you rank, it’s WHERE you’re showing up.

      "text": "Traditional SEO was about backlinks.\n\nLLM SEO is about mentions.\n\nAs search shifts from \"10 blue links\" to AI-generated answers, it’s about being part of the answer training set.\n\nLLM SEO consists of 2 core strategies:\n\n1. Earned = Mentions\n\nLLMs like ChatGPT don’t pull answers out of thin air.\n\nThey generate responses by:\n\n- Running a query\n- Retrieving relevant URLs\n- Summarizing from those pages\n\nIf your brand is consistently mentioned across those sources, you’re more likely to be included in the answer (even if your site isn’t the one being shown).\n\nIt’s the new version of link building.\n\nBut instead of asking:\n\n\"How do I get more backlinks?\"\n\nYou’re asking:\n\n\"How do I get mentioned in content LLMs trust?\"\n\nYou win by:\n\n1. Identifying influential source URLs\n2. Getting your brand mentioned by them\n3. Monitoring your mentions across AI results\n\nTip: Use a tool like Mentions for steps 1 and 3.\n\n2. Owned = Content\n\nThis is your own domain.\n\nWhen you optimize your site to answer specific questions clearly (using Q&A blocks, semantic HTML, topic hubs), LLMs can lift your content directly into answers.\n\nIt’s like building a mini knowledge base.\n\nBut not for people... for LLMs.\n\nEarned and owned together help you:\n\n- Influence what LLMs know about you\n- Control how you’re represented\n- Stay visible as search shifts to conversations\n\nSo the real question now is:\n\n“Are you part of the answer training set?”\n\nPS. Here's an example of earned and owned working together to help Adobe dominate LLMs:",

What about Vibe SEO?\n\nVibe coding turns dev cycles from weeks to hours using tools like Cursor, Replit, and Lovable.\n\nVibe marketing turns smart marketers with the right tools into a 10x marketing team.\n\nVibe SEO turns SEOs into full teams, using instinct and automation to win search presence faster than ever.\n\n6 ways Vibe SEO is already happening:\n\n1. Using instinct to capitalize on search trends before keyword research tools pick them up.\n\nE.g. Creating a \"[Tool] Alternatives\" page within 24 hours of a competitor's Product Hunt launch.\n\n2. Using automation to execute at scale.\n\nE.g. Generating 200 blog posts with Byword.ai based on competitors' sitemaps or keyword frameworks.\n\n3. Repurposing content across channels.\n\nE.g. Building an AI agent that turns LinkedIn, X, or YouTube content into blog posts.\n\n4. Spinning up SEO/linkable assets quickly.\n\nE.g. Using Cursor or Lovable to launch a free tool for lead generation without a developer.\n\n5. Capturing search presence across platforms.\n\nE.g. Building an AI agent that turns content into Reddit answers or LinkedIn Pulse/Medium articles.\n\n6. Winning brand mentions that LLMs actually cite.\n\nE.g. Exporting most frequent citations from Mentions.so and automating the outreach to get your brand included.\n\nSEO isn’t slow anymore.\n\nAutomation, intuition, tools, and speed now beat teams, budgets, and wait times.\n\nThe ones who adapt will dominate the new search wave.",

      "text": "The future of SEO is already here.\n\nHere are 6 tips to rank in LLMs:\n\n1. Win brand mentions\n\n- Get your brand mentioned on high-authority websites\n- Contribute to industry publications\n- Be featured in news outlets\n- Engage in forums and community discussions\n- Encourage authentic UGC and word-of-mouth mentions\n\n2. Build brand equity\n\n- Monitor online reviews and brand sentiment\n- Respond to feedback and address complaints\n- Build a consistent, trustworthy public image\n- Use tools like Mentions.so to track visibility, sentiment, and competitors\n\n3. Be the source\n\n- Publish authoritative, reference-style content\n- Use a neutral, factual, data-backed tone\n- Avoid excessive personal takes or fluff\n- Regularly update key content for accuracy\n- Include credible citations and external data sources\n\n4. Embrace passage-level SEO\n\n- Structure content into short, focused paragraphs\n- Use clear subheadings for logical segmentation\n- Include concise, standalone answers\n- Avoid burying insights in long text block\n- Add structured data (e.g. schema markup)\n- Make each paragraph extractable and cite-ready\n\n5. Cover the conversation\n\n- Use tools like Semrush for question research\n- Monitor forums/socials for emerging questions\n- Identify and answer sub-questions users ask\n- Add relevant FAQs and support content\n- Internally link related topic clusters\n\n6. Optimize for crawlability\n\n- Ensure AI crawlers are allowed in robots.txt\n- Verify CDN settings (e.g. Cloudflare) aren't blocking crawlers\n- Submit up-to-date XML sitemaps in Google Search Console\n- Optimize for fast page speed and clean HTML\n- Review server logs for GPTBot, BingBot, etc. behaviour\n\nBut first, start with an audit:\n\n- Your current visibility across all LLMs\n- Prompt and content gaps vs your competitors\n- Technical issues preventing AI from citing your site\n\nUse a tool like Mentions.so to find this information (launching in the next 12 hours, join the waitlist for early access).\n\nDon’t regret not starting “New SEO” sooner.",

      "text": "My 31-step SEO checklist for creating new blog posts:\n\nPhase 1: Topic Research\n\nIdentify the primary keyword for your topic. This is typically the most popular keyword related to your topic.\n\nIdentify the secondary keywords for your topic. These are keywords closely related to your primary keyword.\n\nDetermine the intent of your topic. Search your primary keyword and analyze the pages Google is rewarding.\n\nEnsure you can solve the searcher's problem. Your content should fulfil the searcher's query and solve their problem.\n\nPhase 2: Content\n\nReverse engineer the current featured snippet and implement your own.\n\nWrite your blog post’s headings (H2-H4) by incorporating the primary and secondary keywords.\n\nReverse-engineer competitor content and add new headings based on what your competitors are covering.\n\nLook for Google Autosuggest, People Also Ask, and Related Searches to find other search data you can include as headings/sections.\n\nAdd new headings and sections based on your knowledge of the topic and information gathered via ICPs.\n\nMake sure the content flows, is skimmable, has good readability, and covers all subtopics.\n\nEnsure images are compressed to <100KB (or as small as possible).\n\nLink to relevant articles and optimize anchor text.\n\nUse bullets, numbered lists, and tables where possible for clarity and readability.\n\nUse short sentences and paragraphs for readability.\n\nPhase 3: Optimization\n\nInclude CTAs relevant to the reader's awareness level and search intent.\n\nAdd a table of contents to the top of the page for better navigation.\n\nEnsure the title is compelling and includes the primary keyword.\n\nEnsure the URL is short, concise, and includes the primary keyword.\n\nCheck if the word count is within 200-400 words higher or lower than the top 1-4 competitor average. If not, ensure your content covers everything.\n\nWrite concise and descriptive alt-text for images.\n\nCraft a meta description that is highly relevant to the topic and includes the primary keyword. Ensure it is between 150 and 160 characters and gives a reason for the user to click.\n\nAvoid using the primary keyword more than once in H2-H6 headings to prevent over-optimization. Use secondary keywords and variations instead.\n\nHook the reader in the introduction by including the topic in the first sentence or paragraph.\n\nTie the conclusion back to the main topic.\n\nBold/italicise key text (sentences and/or paragraphs) for emphasis.\n\nInclude contextual external links to clarify jargon terms.\n\nLink to any references used to cite your sources.\n\nRun your final draft through an optimization tool like Clearscope, Surfer, or Frase.\n\nPhase 4: New SEO\n\nGo to the comments (I've run out of characters) 👇",

      "text": "The best SEO masterclass you'll see this week.\n\n7 strategies behind Canva's dominance:\n\n- 270M monthly traffic\n- 35M backlinks\n- 190 target countries\n- $100Ms SEO revenue\n- $26B valuation\n\n1. Programmatic SEO\n\nCanva created 1,000s of SEO-focused pages at scale.\n\nThey're divided into 3 main categories:\n\n- Builder (e.g. Resume Builder or Logo Maker)\n- Templates (e.g. YouTube Banner Template)\n- Create (e.g. Create Logo or Create CV)\n\nThese pages alone get 100M+ monthly SEO traffic.\n\nAnd even a low 1% conversion rate acquires at least 1M new Canva users a month.\n\n2. Product-Led Conversions\n\nCanva converts traffic by providing tools to create what the user has searched for, directly on the page, with ready-made templates inside the product.\n\nThis aligns with their freemium model:\n\nA. Converts traffic to start using the platform right away (on the highly valuable free plan).\n\nB. Free plan users later upgrade to a paid plan to unlock even more features.\n\n3. Content Clusters\n\nCanva created groups of related pages that build topical authority around specific design topics.\n\nFor example:\n\nSubfolder: /colors\nPage: /colors/color-meanings\nSubpage: /colors/color-meanings/blue\n\nThis is how you dominate your search market.\n\nThe 'Colors' cluster alone has 3.8K pages, all interlinked, which generates 2M monthly SEO traffic.\n\n4. Internal Linking\n\nCanva ensures that high-authority pages pass ‘authority’ to relevant subpages through internal linking.\n\nFor example:\n\nHigh authority page: Flyer Templates\nSubpage link: Restaurant Flyer Templates\n\nThat single link makes the subpage rank.\n\n5. Backlinks\nCanva has 35M backlinks from 338K websites, resulting in a 93 Domain Rating.\n\nStandard outreach and PR aside...\n\nHere are 3 strategies they used to EARN backlinks:\n\nA. Link-worthy content\n\nHigh-quality content that other websites cite.\n\nFor example:\n\nPage: Ultimate Guide to Font Combinations\nBacklinks: 2.8K (organically)\n\nB. App integrations\n\nNew apps consistently get listed on Canva.\n\nThese apps often create content around their Canva integration, which results in a backlink.\n\nC. Acquisitions\n\nCanva bought these websites:\n\nPexels: DR 92\nAffinity: DR 82\nPixabay: DR 92\nFlourish: DR 84\nLeonardo: DR 76\nDesignify: DR 48\nUnscreen: DR 65\nRemove bg: DR 81\nSmartmockups: DR 67\n\nNow they all link to Canva's website.\n\nReminder: Build backlinks from all your owned websites. These are the easiest links you'll get.\n\n6.

If so, how?\n\nCan you make the meta title more compelling for higher CTR?\n\nCan you make your meta description more compelling to click?\n\nDoes your image alt-text concisely explain what the images are?\n\nWhat relevant pages can you internally link from?\n\nAre there any pages you can link to?\n\nAre you including CTAs relevant to the reader’s awareness level or search intent?\n\nPhase 5: “New” SEO\n\nHave you optimized for Google’s AI Overview?\n↳ Structure your content to be easily summarized by AI\n↳ Focus on concise answers and bullet points\n\nHave you incorporated EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)?\n↳ Highlight author credentials and link to authoritative sources to build trust\n\nHave you adapted headings for voice search?\n↳ Use conversational language and question headings\n\nHave you optimized for multi-device usability?\n↳  Ensure content is accessible and user-friendly across different devices",

This is typically the most popular keyword related to your topic.\n\nIdentify the secondary keywords for your topic. These are keywords closely related to your primary keyword.\n\nDetermine the intent of your topic. Search your primary keyword and analyze the pages Google is rewarding.\n\nEnsure you can solve the searcher's problem. Your content should fulfil the searcher's query and solve their problem.\n\nPhase 2: Content\n\nReverse engineer the current featured snippet and implement your own.\n\nWrite your blog post’s headings (H2-H4) by incorporating the primary and secondary keywords.\n\nReverse-engineer competitor content and add new headings based on what your competitors are covering.\n\nLook for Google Autosuggest, People Also Ask, and Related Searches to find other search data you can include as headings/sections.\n\nAdd new headings and sections based on your knowledge of the topic and information gathered via ICPs.\n\nMake sure the content flows, is skimmable, has good readability, and covers all subtopics.\n\nEnsure images are compressed to <100KB (or as small as possible).\n\nLink to relevant articles and optimize anchor text.\n\nUse bullets, numbered lists, and tables where possible for clarity and readability.\n\nUse short sentences and paragraphs for readability.\n\nPhase 3: Optimization\n\nInclude CTAs relevant to the reader's awareness level and search intent.\n\nAdd a table of contents to the top of the page for better navigation.\n\nEnsure the title is compelling and includes the primary keyword.\n\nEnsure the URL is short, concise, and includes the primary keyword.\n\nCheck if the word count is within 200-400 words higher or lower than the top 1-4 competitor average. If not, ensure your content covers everything.\n\nWrite concise and descriptive alt-text for images.\n\nCraft a meta description that is highly relevant to the topic and includes the primary keyword. Ensure it is between 150 and 160 characters and gives a reason for the user to click.\n\nAvoid using the primary keyword more than once in H2-H6 headings to prevent over-optimization. Use secondary keywords and variations instead.\n\nHook the reader in the introduction by including the topic in the first sentence or paragraph.\n\nTie the conclusion back to the main topic.\n\nBold/italicise key text (sentences and/or paragraphs) for emphasis.\n\nInclude contextual external links to clarify jargon terms.\n\nLink to any references used to cite your sources.\n\nRun your final draft through an optimisation tool like Clearscope, Surfer, or Frase.\n\nPhase 4: New SEO\n\nGo to the comments (I've run out of characters) 👇",

Hero section\n\nCompany logo: Ensure branding is immediately visible.\n\nHeadline: Benefit-driven headline that captures attention and clearly states the (compelling) value proposition.\n\nSubheadline: Supporting statement that adds further clarity to the headline.\n\nPrimary CTA: Button that stands out and guides the user to the desired next step.\n\nSocial proof: Show that people like the reader are also using the product (and how many).\n\nImage or video: Add an image, video, or GIF that visually communicates the product in action, making it easy for users to understand how it works.\n\n2. Benefits section\n\nKey benefits: Show the main benefits of the product and give a brief description of the features that achieve this.\n\nSupporting visuals: Include images to reinforce the benefits and showcase the product in action.\n\n3. More social proof\n\nTestimonials: Include quotes from satisfied customers to increase authenticity.\n\nTrust signals: Add logos of well-known brands or individual users to further establish credibility.\n\n4. FAQ section\n\nAddress the most frequently asked questions to overcome any objections.\n\nUse Google autosuggest, keyword research tools, and search modifiers to find SEO-focused questions to further optimise for your target keyword(s).\n\n5. Final call to action (CTA)\n\nEncourage users to take immediate action.\n\n6. Internal linking\n\nLinks to related features: Provide links to other feature pages to keep users exploring.\n\nMake sure to also link to the new landing page from other pages with optimized anchor text.\n\n7. Mobile optimization\n\nEnsure the landing page is fully optimized for mobile users with quick load times, easy navigation, and mobile-friendly CTAs.\n\n8. Footer section\n\nContact information: Include contact details like email, phone number, and address or a link to support.\n\nLegal information: Provide links to important pages such as Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\n9. Repeat for every feature\n\nWe created 8 of these feature pages for a B2B SaaS company several months back.\n\nThey now:\n\n- Rank for searches directly looking for their product\n- Get 20,000+ \"warm\" SEO traffic per month\n\nIt works.",

Crawling: Discover and collect web pages\n2. Rendering: Analyze how pages look and function\n3. Indexing: Organize and store page information\n4. Ranking: Determine relevance and order of pages\n5. Querying: Display relevant results for user searches\n\nThe diagram below shows this process.\n\nRemember:\n\nIf Google can't discover your pages, your content won't be crawled or rendered.\n\nPages are discovered through:\n\n- The submitted sitemap\n- Manual page submission\n- Internal links (i.e. hub pages)\n\nIf Google can't crawl or render your content, your page won't be indexed.\nPossible issues:\n\n- Network issues\n- Problems with the server\n- Not accessible without logging in\n- Robots.txt code preventing access\n- Disallowed for crawling by the owner\n\nIf Google can't index your page, you won't rank in the search results for relevant queries.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Low-quality content\n- Irrelevant content to the query\n- Code preventing indexing (noindex)\n- Design of the site making it difficult\n\nIf Google doesn't rank your page, you won't show in Google or get any organic traffic.\n\nSEO helps your website pass each step.\n\nRemember these stages next time you're publishing a page or struggling to rank in Google.",

Though not a direct ranking factor, it's bolded in search results and should include a call-to-action (CTA).\n- Description: Write a descriptive meta that entices clicks, similar to a well-crafted ad.\n- URL: Ensure it matches your target keywords. Avoid duplicate page structures and refrain from including years in URLs.\n\nSchema Markup:\n\n- Implement schema types like Article, BlogPosting, and Breadcrumbs for enhanced SERP presentation.\n\nOriginal Images:\n\n- Every image should have an Alt attribute for SEO and accessibility.\n\nContent-Length:\n\n- Aim for a minimum of 700 words, adjusting based on competition and query specificity.\n\nAble of Contents with Jump Links:\n\n- Utilize anchor links for easy navigation. Google indexes these, enhancing user experience (UX) and providing valuable data.\n\nHeading Structure:\n\n- Follow a proper format with a single H1 and supporting text under each heading. Use H3s and H4s appropriately.\n\nInternal Links:\n\n- Ensure every page has internal links leading to and from it. This aids in crawl efficiency and contextual relevance.\n\nProduct Card Embeds:\n\n- Embed product cards to increase CTR. Test different CTAs, especially for high-traffic articles.\n\nHTML Elements:\n\n- Use lists, tables, and accordions to capture featured snippets and improve UX metrics like session duration.\n\nYouTube Video Embed:\n\n- Ideally, pair each blog post with a complementary YouTube video. Embedding videos can serve as backlinks and enhance visibility on both Google and YouTube.\n\nCTA for Engagement:\n\n- Encourage user engagement with clear CTAs. This can lead to better interaction metrics and conversions.\n\nCheck off each one of these when creating your blog post. And you'll not just be writing content.\n\nYou'll be crafting an experience that resonates with your readers and search engines alike.",

      "text": "My 31-step SEO checklist for creating new blog posts:\n\nPhase 1: Topic Research\n\nIdentify the primary keyword for your topic. This is typically the most popular keyword related to your topic.\n\nIdentify the secondary keywords for your topic. These are keywords closely related to your primary keyword.\n\nDetermine the intent of your topic. Search your primary keyword and analyze the pages Google is rewarding.\n\nEnsure you can solve the searcher's problem. Your content should fulfil the searcher's query and solve their problem.\n\nPhase 2: Content\n\nReverse engineer the current featured snippet and implement your own.\n\nWrite your blog post’s headings (H2-H4) by incorporating the primary and secondary keywords.\n\nReverse-engineer competitor content and add new headings based on what your competitors are covering.\n\nLook for Google Autosuggest, People Also Ask, and Related Searches to find other search data you can include as headings/sections.\n\nAdd new headings and sections based on your knowledge of the topic and information gathered via ICPs.\n\nMake sure the content flows, is skimmable, has good readability, and covers all subtopics.\n\nEnsure images are compressed to <100KB (or as small as possible).\n\nLink to relevant articles and optimize anchor text.\n\nUse bullets, numbered lists, and tables where possible for clarity and readability.\n\nUse short sentences and paragraphs for readability.\n\nPhase 3: Optimization\n\nInclude CTAs relevant to the reader's awareness level and search intent.\n\nAdd a table of contents to the top of the page for better navigation.\n\nEnsure the title is compelling and includes the primary keyword.\n\nEnsure the URL is short, concise, and includes the primary keyword.\n\nCheck if the word count is within 200-400 words higher or lower than the top 1-4 competitor average. If not, ensure your content covers everything.\n\nWrite concise and descriptive alt-text for images.\n\nCraft a meta description that is highly relevant to the topic and includes the primary keyword. Ensure it is between 150 and 160 characters and gives a reason for the user to click.\n\nAvoid using the primary keyword more than once in H2-H6 headings to prevent over-optimization. Use secondary keywords and variations instead.\n\nHook the reader in the introduction by including the topic in the first sentence or paragraph.\n\nTie the conclusion back to the main topic.\n\nBold/italicise key text (sentences and/or paragraphs) for emphasis.\n\nInclude contextual external links to clarify jargon terms.\n\nLink to any references used to cite your sources.\n\nRun your final draft through an optimization tool like Clearscope, Surfer, or Frase.\n\nPhase 4: New SEO\n\nGo to the comments (I've run out of characters) 👇",

Technical Fixes\n\nWe ran an audit and fixed standard issues like:\n\n- Canonical tags\n- Broken internal links\n- Missing titles/descriptions\n\nBut crucially:\n\nTheir traffic was about to tank and they had no idea.\n\nThey switched URL versions from www. to non-www. and didn’t update any internal links or add redirects.\n\nI've seen -90% traffic drops with this issue in the past.\n\nThankfully, we were able to fix it early.\n\n2. Programmatic\n\nWe published over 300+ new pages that funnel traffic into their software's core features.\n\n(You can use a tool like Byword for this)\n\n- We asked the client where they wanted to focus\n- We found keyword frameworks with 100s of variables\n- We created a list of all possible variables to target\n- We used AI to create content at scale (e.g. Byword)\n- We published 300+ new pages over 6 months\n\n3. Lower-Funnel Blogs\n\nWe published 75+ lower-funnel pages over 6 months, specifically targeting ready-to-buy searchers.\n\nTitle framework examples:\n\n- [Competitor] Alternatives\n- [Competitor] vs [Client]\n- How to [Solve Problem]\n- Best [Product] in 2024\n\n4. Free Tools\n\nWe created free tools to funnel traffic into their email list and software's core features.\n\nFor example: [Relevant Metric] Calculator\n\nThese keywords typically get 1,000s of daily searches.\n\n5. Optimizing existing content\n\nWe audited keywords to find pages ranking in position 3-20 and optimized the \"quickest wins\".\n\n- Writing new sections\n- Adding to existing sections\n- Optimizing existing headings\n- Targeting featured snippets and AI Overviews\n\nThe client came to us with:\n\n- Declining organic traffic\n- Increased competition in the market\n- Bottlenecks in content production (small team)\n- Insufficient resources to handle large-scale SEO\n\n12 months later, they’ve seen:\n\n- 400+ new pages\n- 4,000+ first-page rankings\n- 425,000 total new SEO traffic\n- Growing +25% monthly\n- 10,634 leads and 3,786 paid signups\n\nDo you want to turn SEO into a 7-figure sales channel?\n\nLet's talk: https://hubs.ly/Q02xzlLL0",

Content optimization.\n\nHere's the background:\n\nThe client published 300+ blog posts over 2 years but only had ~1K/mo traffic (which was declining).\n\nThey had invested 6-figures into their blog and wanted to get more out of their existing content.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Content audit\n\nWe identified:\n\n- Posts nearly ranking (low-hanging fruit)\n- Posts with potential but poorly optimized\n- Posts without any value to users or Google\n- Posts targeting multiple 'intents' to separate\n- Posts on the same topic that could be merged\n\nWe prioritized the posts based on getting the quickest increase in traffic possible.\n\n2. Content optimization\n\nWe optimized content that had potential (~20%).\n\nFor each post, we focused on:\n\n- Introduction\n- Internal linking\n- Word presence\n- Topic coverage\n- Matching intent\n- Term frequency\n- Featured snippets\n- Content structure\n\nWe completed this over a 90-day sprint.\n\nWe hit 120K+ per month in 180 days.\n\nSoon after, we started publishing new content and quickly surpassed 150K+/mo SEO traffic.\n\nQuestions? Ask below:\n\n(I'm responding to them all)\n\nDo you want to turn SEO into a 7-figure sales channel?\n\nLet’s talk: https://lnkd.in/eeYhsc9Y",

Hero section\n\nCompany logo: Ensure branding is immediately visible.\n\nHeadline: Benefit-driven headline that captures attention and clearly states the (compelling) value proposition.\n\nSubheadline: Supporting statement that adds further clarity to the headline.\n\nPrimary CTA: Button that stands out and guides the user to the desired next step.\n\nSocial proof: Show that people like the reader are also using the product (and how many).\n\nImage or video: Add an image, video, or GIF that visually communicates the product in action, making it easy for users to understand how it works.\n\n2. Benefits section\n\nKey benefits: Show the main benefits of the product and give a brief description of the features that achieve this.\n\nSupporting visuals: Include images to reinforce the benefits and showcase the product in action.\n\n3. More social proof\n\nTestimonials: Include quotes from satisfied customers to increase authenticity.\n\nTrust signals: Add logos of well-known brands or individual users to further establish credibility.\n\n4. FAQ section\n\nAddress the most frequently asked questions to overcome any objections.\n\nUse Google autosuggest, keyword research tools, and search modifiers to find SEO-focused questions to further optimize for your target keyword(s).\n\n5. Final call to action (CTA)\n\nEncourage users to take immediate action.\n\n6. Internal linking\n\nLinks to related features: Provide links to other feature pages to keep users exploring.\n\nMake sure to also link to the new landing page from other pages with optimized anchor text.\n\n7. Mobile optimization\n\nEnsure the landing page is fully optimized for mobile users with quick load times, easy navigation, and mobile-friendly CTAs.\n\n8. Footer section\n\nContact information: Include contact details like email, phone number, and address or a link to support.\n\nLegal information: Provide links to important pages such as Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\n9. Repeat for every feature\n\nWe created 8 of these feature pages for a B2B SaaS company a few months back.\n\nThey now:\n\n- Rank for searches directly looking for their product\n- Get 20,000+ \"warm\" SEO traffic per month\n\nIt works.",

      "text": "17 most common SEO issues we find:\n\n(That can be easily fixed)\n\n1. Duplicate Content: Having the same or very similar content on multiple pages can negatively impact SEO.\n\n2. Broken Links: Links that lead nowhere or to error pages create a bad user experience and can harm SEO.\n\n3. Slow Page Load Times: Slow-loading pages can frustrate users and negatively affect search engine rankings.\n\n4. Old Publish Dates: Avoid older dates showing up against recently published or updated content. This hurts your CTR and your rankings\n\n5. Thin Content: Pages with very little useful content are often ranked lower by search engines.\n\n6. Missing Alt Tags and Broken Images: Images without alt tags or broken images can affect SEO as they contribute to the overall content quality and accessibility.\n\n7. Unoptimized Meta Descriptions and Titles: Titles and descriptions that are not optimized for keywords and readability can impact click-through rates and rankings.\n\n8. Improper Use of Header Tags: Not using header tags (H1, H2, etc.) correctly can make it harder for search engines to understand the structure and content of a page.\n\n9. Lack of Quality Backlinks: Not having enough high-quality backlinks can affect a site's authority and ranking.\n\n10. Poor User Experience (UX): Websites that are difficult to navigate or unengaging can lead to high bounce rates, which can negatively impact SEO.\n\n11. Overuse of Keywords (Keyword Stuffing): Excessively using keywords can lead to penalties from search engines for spammy behavior.\n\n12. Not Using Structured Data (Schema Markup): Failing to implement structured data can result in missed opportunities to enhance search result listings and improve click-through rates.\n\n13. Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) for Local SEO: Inconsistencies in business listings can harm local SEO efforts.\n\n14. Ignoring Social Signals: While not a direct ranking factor, social signals (like shares and likes) can indirectly affect SEO by increasing visibility and traffic.\n\n15. Image Pages in WordPress: Every image uploaded may have its own page, which Google indexes. Plugins like Yoast can redirect attachment URLs to the image, maintaining a clean site footprint.\n\n16. HTTP Pages: Ensure all pages are secure (HTTPS). Use the ‘site:domain inurl:-https’ search command to find non-secure pages.\n\n17. Unintended Indexed Pages: Perform a site:domain search with terms like “Lorem ipsum,” “Portfolio,” “Demo,” “Index,” “Error,” “Test,” or a blank search to find and address low-quality pages.\n\nWhat other common SEO issues would you add?",

      "text": "The best SEO masterclass you'll see this week.\n\n7 strategies behind Canva's dominance:\n\n- 260M monthly traffic\n- 35M backlinks\n- 190 target countries\n- $100Ms SEO revenue\n- $26B valuation\n\n1. Programmatic SEO\n\nCanva created 1,000s of SEO-focused pages at scale.\n\nThey're divided into 3 main categories:\n\n- Builder (e.g. Resume Builder or Logo Maker)\n- Templates (e.g. YouTube Banner Template)\n- Create (e.g. Create Logo or Create CV)\n\nThese pages alone get 100M+ monthly SEO traffic.\n\nAnd even a low 1% conversion rate acquires at least 1M new Canva users a month.\n\n2. Product-Led Conversions\n\nCanva converts traffic by providing tools to create what the user has searched for, directly on the page, with ready-made templates inside the product.\n\nThis aligns with their freemium model:\n\nA. Converts traffic to start using the platform right away (on the highly valuable free plan).\n\nB. Free plan users later upgrade to a paid plan to unlock even more features.\n\n3. Content Clusters\n\nCanva created groups of related pages that build topical authority around specific design topics.\n\nFor example:\n\nSubfolder: /colors\nPage: /colors/color-meanings\nSubpage: /colors/color-meanings/blue\n\nThis is how you dominate your search market.\n\nThe 'Colors' cluster alone has 3.8K pages, all interlinked, which generates 2M monthly SEO traffic.\n\n4. Internal Linking\n\nCanva ensures that high-authority pages pass ‘authority’ to relevant subpages through internal linking.\n\nFor example:\n\nHigh authority page: Flyer Templates\nSubpage link: Restaurant Flyer Templates\n\nThat single link makes the subpage rank.\n\n5. Backlinks\n\nCanva has 35M backlinks from 338K websites, resulting in a 93 Domain Rating.\n\nStandard outreach and PR aside...\n\nHere are 3 strategies they used to EARN backlinks:\n\nA. Link-worthy content\n\nHigh-quality content that other websites cite.\n\nFor example:\n\nPage: Ultimate Guide to Font Combinations\nBacklinks: 2.8K (organically)\n\nB. App integrations\n\nNew apps consistently get listed on Canva.\n\nThese apps often create content around their Canva integration, which results in a backlink.\n\nC. Acquisitions\n\nCanva bought these websites:\n\nPexels: DR 92\nAffinity: DR 82\nPixabay: DR 92\nFlourish: DR 84\nLeonardo: DR 76\nDesignify: DR 48\nUnscreen: DR 65\nRemove bg: DR 81\nSmartmockups: DR 67\n\nNow they all link to Canva's website.\n\nReminder: Build backlinks from all your owned websites. These are the easiest links you'll get.\n\n6. Localised and Multilingual SEO\n\nCanva localised versions of their website to target all languages and regions, making them a global behemoth.\n\nFor example:\n\nLatin America = 34M monthly traffic\nIndonesia = 12M monthly traffic\nBrazil = 15M monthly traffic\n\n7. Trending Content\n\nCanva keeps up with trends to drive traffic for current high-demand, low-competition keywords.\n\nFor example:\n\nDuring the pandemic, the search demand for 'Zoom Backgrounds' skyrocketed.\n\nNew page: Free Zoom Background Templates\nResult: 100K+ new monthly SEO traffic\n\nWho should I break down next?",

Then you find what works and stay consistent.\n\nOver time, you start seeing incremental improvements. Until one day, you look in the mirror and see a healthy, chiselled, and transformed body.\n\nSEO works in the same way.\n\nSo the next time your CEO asks you to justify spending $1,000s/mo on SEO with no immediate return...\n\nSend them this visual:",

Content optimization.\n\nHere's the background:\n\nThe client published 300+ blog posts over 2 years but only had ~1K/mo traffic (which was declining).\n\nThey had invested 6-figures into their blog and wanted to get more out of their existing content.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Content audit\n\nWe identified:\n\n- Posts nearly ranking (low-hanging fruit)\n- Posts with potential but poorly optimized\n- Posts without any value to users or Google\n- Posts targeting multiple 'intents' to separate\n- Posts on the same topic that could be merged\n\nWe prioritized the posts based on getting the quickest increase in traffic possible.\n\n2. Content optimization\n\nWe optimized content that had potential (~20%).\n\nFor each post, we focused on:\n\n- Introduction\n- Internal linking\n- Word presence\n- Topic coverage\n- Matching intent\n- Term frequency\n- Featured snippets\n- Content structure\n\nWe completed this over a 90-day sprint.\n\nWe hit 120K+ per month in 180 days.\n\nSoon after, we started publishing new content and quickly surpassed 150K+/mo SEO traffic.\n\nDo you want to turn SEO into a 7-figure sales channel?\n\nLet’s talk: https://hubs.ly/Q02yV2hb0",

Each case is different and requires a custom-made approach.\n\nBut the fundamentals are always the same, and you should work on them simultaneously.\n\nIt's simple, but not easy.\n\nYou need to create a tailored plan and follow it consistently.\n\nIt's all just science.\n\nYou have to feed the 'algorithm' the right stuff, and you should stick to healthy strategies only.\n\nMaking incremental 1% tweaks can compound and make a huge difference in the long term.\n\nMost people give up too soon.\n\nWhen you've reached your goal, you can't just stop. You should maintain the habits that have brought you growth.\n\nThe first stage of growth is much easier to achieve than the last.\n\nThe last stage often requires the most work and only sees smaller, incremental improvements.\n\nWhat would you add?",

Enter each URL into Google Search Console or Ahrefs and find its best-ranking keywords.\n\nAdd this data to the spreadsheet for each page:\n\n- Primary keyword (your main keyword)\n- Secondary keywords (variations and similar)\n- Current position for your target keyword(s)\n\nIf a URL isn't ranking for anything?\n\nFind the most relevant keywords using Ahrefs.\n\n3. Audit each blog post and assign actions:\n\n- Leave: Content that’s reached its full potential\n- Merge: Cannibalising or extremely similar content\n- Delete: Content that no longer offers value to users\n- Update: Small changes to improve the performance\n- Rewrite: Large changes to improve the performance\n\n4. Spend a few weeks in Q1 implementing these actions to get more out of your existing assets.\n\nPrioritise updates and rewrites that have:\n\n- Target keywords in positions 4-20\n- Higher conversion and $ potential\n- Easy improvement opportunities\n\nRemember:\n\nNot all of your Q1 content needs to be new.

If so, how?\n\nCan you make the meta title more compelling for higher CTR?\n\nCan you make your meta description more compelling to click?\n\nDoes your image alt-text concisely explain what the images are?\n\nWhat relevant pages can you internally link from?\n\nAre there any pages you can link to?\n\nAre you including CTAs relevant to the reader’s awareness level or search intent?\n\nPhase 5: “New” SEO\n\nHave you optimised for Google’s AI Overview?\n↳ Structure your content to be easily summarised by AI\n↳ Focus on concise answers and bullet points\n\nHave you incorporated EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)?\n↳ Highlight author credentials and link to authoritative sources to build trust\n\nHave you adapted headings for voice search?\n↳ Use conversational language and question headings\n\nHave you optimised for multi-device usability?\n↳  Ensure content is accessible and user-friendly across different devices",

Crawling: Discover and collect web pages\n2. Rendering: Analyse how pages look and function\n3. Indexing: Organise and store page information\n4. Ranking: Determine relevance and order of pages\n5. Querying: Display relevant results for user searches\n\nWe’ve created the diagram below to show this process.\n\nRemember:\n\nIf Google can't discover your pages, your content won't be crawled or rendered.\n\nPages are discovered through:\n\n- The submitted sitemap\n- Manual page submission\n- Internal links (i.e. hub pages)\n\nIf Google can't crawl or render your content, your page won't be indexed.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Network issues\n- Problems with the server\n- Not accessible without logging in\n- Robots.txt code preventing access\n- Disallowed for crawling by the owner\n\nIf Google can't index your page, you won't rank in the search results for relevant queries.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n- Low-quality content\n- Irrelevant content to the query\n- Code preventing indexing (noindex)\n- Design of the site making it difficult\n\nIf Google doesn't rank your page, you won't show in Google or get any organic traffic.\n\nSEO helps your website pass each step.\n\nRemember these stages next time you're publishing a page or struggling to rank in Google.",

This is typically the most popular keyword related to your topic.\n\nIdentify the secondary keywords for your topic. These are keywords closely related to your primary keyword.\n\nDetermine the intent of your topic. Search your primary keyword and analyse the pages Google is rewarding.\n\nEnsure you can solve the searcher's problem. Your content should fulfil the searcher's query and solve their problem.\n \n\n\nPhase 2: Content\n\nReverse engineer the current featured snippet and implement your own.\n\nWrite your blog post’s headings (H2-H4) by incorporating the primary and secondary keywords.\n\nReverse-engineer competitor content and add new headings based on what your competitors are covering.\n\nLook for Google Autosuggest, People Also Ask, and Related Searches to find other search data you can include as headings/sections.\n\nAdd new headings and sections based on your knowledge of the topic and information gathered via ICPs.\n\nMake sure the content flows, is skimmable, has good readability, and covers all subtopics.\n\nEnsure images are compressed to <100KB (or as small as possible).\n\nLink to relevant articles and optimise anchor text.\n\nUse bullets, numbered lists, and tables where possible for clarity and readability.\n\nUse short sentences and paragraphs for readability.\n \n\n\nPhase 3: Optimisation\n\nInclude CTAs relevant to the reader's awareness level and search intent.\n\nAdd a table of contents to the top of the page for better navigation.\n\nEnsure the title is compelling and includes the primary keyword.\n\nEnsure the URL is short, concise, and includes the primary keyword.\n\nCheck if the word count is within 200-400 words higher or lower than the top 1-4 competitor average. If not, ensure your content covers everything.\n\nWrite concise and descriptive alt-text for images.\n\nCraft a meta description that is highly relevant to the topic and includes the primary keyword. Ensure it is between 150 and 160 characters and gives a reason for the user to click.\n\nAvoid using the primary keyword more than once in H2-H6 headings to prevent over-optimisation. Use secondary keywords and variations instead.\n\nHook the reader in the introduction by including the topic in the first sentence or paragraph.\n\nTie the conclusion back to the main topic.\n\nBold/italicise key text (sentences and/or paragraphs) for emphasis.\n\nInclude contextual external links to clarify jargon terms.\n\nLink to any references used to cite your sources.\n\nRun your final draft through an optimisation tool like Clearscope, Surfer, or Frase.\n \nPhase 4: New SEO\nGo to the comments (I've run out of characters) 👇",

Technical Fixes\n\nWe ran an audit and fixed standard issues like:\n\n- Canonical tags\n- Broken internal links\n- Missing titles/descriptions\n\nBut crucially:\n\nTheir traffic was about to tank and they had no idea.\n\nThey switched URL versions from www. to non-www. and didn’t update any internal links or add redirects.\n\nI've seen -90% traffic drops with this issue in the past.\n\nThankfully, we were able to fix it early.\n\n2. Programmatic\n\nWe published over 240+ new pages that funnel traffic into their software's core features.\n\n- We asked the client where they wanted to focus\n- We found keyword frameworks with 100s of variables\n- We created a list of all possible variables to target\n- We used AI to create content at scale (e.g. Byword)\n- We published 240+ new pages over 4 months\n\n3. Lower-Funnel Blogs\n\nWe published 50+ lower-funnel pages over 5 months, specifically targeting ready-to-buy searchers.\n\nTitle framework examples:\n\n- [Competitor] Alternatives\n- [Competitor] vs [Client]\n- How to [Solve Problem]\n- Best [Product] in 2024\n\n4. Free Tools\n\nWe created free tools to funnel traffic into their email list and software's core features.\n\nFor example: [Relevant Metric] Calculator\n\nThese keywords typically get 1,000s of daily searches.\n\n5. Optimising existing content\n\nWe audited keywords to find pages ranking in position 3-20 and optimised the \"quickest wins\".\n\n- Writing new sections\n- Adding to existing sections\n- Optimising existing headings\n- Targeting featured snippets and AI Overviews\n\nThe client came to us with:\n\n- Declining organic traffic\n- Increased competition in the market\n- Bottlenecks in content production (small team)\n- Insufficient resources to handle large-scale SEO\n\n8 months later, they’ve seen:\n\n- 300+ new pages\n- 3,146 first-page rankings\n- 275,000 total SEO traffic\n- Growing +30% monthly\n- 6,255 leads and 2,227 paid signups\n\nDo you want to turn SEO into a 7-figure sales channel?\n\nLet’s talk: https://hubs.ly/Q02yV2hb0",

Hero section\n\nCompany logo: Ensure branding is immediately visible.\n\nHeadline: Benefit-driven headline that captures attention and clearly states the (compelling) value proposition.\n\nE.g. \"Discover and create the best LinkedIn content\"\n\nSubheadline: Supporting statement that adds further clarity to the headline.\n\nE.g. \"Kleo is the free browser extension that helps you easily find inspiration and create content on LinkedIn.\"\n\nPrimary CTA: Button that stands out and guides the user to the desired next step.\n\nE.g. \"Install on Chrome\"\n\nSocial proof: Show that people like the reader are also using the product (and how many).\n\nE.g. \"Loved by 27,000 LinkedIn users\" (include visuals like user images or logos)\n\nImage or video: Add an image, video, or GIF that visually communicates the product in action, making it easy for users to understand how it works.\n\n2. Benefits section\n\nKey benefits: Show the main benefits of the product and give a brief description of the features that achieve this.\n\nE.g. \"Study any creator’s content. Zoom in on your favourite creators to get better insight into their content and standout posts.\"\n\nSupporting visuals: Include images to reinforce the benefits and showcase the product in action.\n\n3. More social proof\n\nTestimonials: Include quotes from satisfied customers to increase authenticity.\n\nTrust signals: Add logos of well-known brands or individual users to further establish credibility.\n\nE.g. \"Trusted by 1,000+ teams worldwide\"\n\n4. FAQ section\n\nAddress the most frequently asked questions to overcome any objections.\nE.g. \"Is Kleo detected by LinkedIn?\"\n\nUse Google autosuggest, keyword research tools, and search modifiers to find SEO-focused questions to further optimise for your target keyword(s).\n\nE.g. \"Why is Kleo the best LinkedIn content tool?\"\n\n5. Final call to action (CTA)\n\nEncourage users to take immediate action.\n\nE.g. \"Start using Kleo for free\"\n\n6. Internal linking\n\nLinks to related features: Provide links to other feature pages to keep users exploring.\n\nE.g. “See how you can preview posts with Kleo\"\n\nMake sure to also link to the new landing page from other pages with optimised anchor text.\n\n7. Mobile optimisation\n\nEnsure the landing page is fully optimised for mobile users with quick load times, easy navigation, and mobile-friendly CTAs.\n\n8. Footer section\n\nContact information: Include contact details like email, phone number, and address or a link to support.\n\nLegal information: Provide links to important pages such as Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\n9. Repeat for every feature\n\nWe created 8 of these feature pages for a B2B SaaS company a few months ago.\n\nThey now:\n\n- Rank for searches directly looking for their product\n- Get 20,000+ \"warm\" SEO traffic per month\n\nIt really works.",

Content optimisation.\n\nHere's the background:\n\nThe client published 300+ blog posts over 2 years but only had ~1K/mo traffic (which was declining).\n\nThey had invested 6-figures into their blog and wanted to get more out of their existing content.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Content audit\n\nWe identified:\n\n- Posts nearly ranking (low-hanging fruit)\n- Posts with potential but poorly optimised\n- Posts without any value to users or Google\n- Posts targeting multiple 'intents' to separate\n- Posts on the same topic that could be merged\n\nWe prioritised the posts based on getting the quickest increase in traffic possible.\n\n2. Content optimisation\n\nWe optimised content that had potential (~20%).\n\nFor each post, we focused on:\n\n- Introduction\n- Internal linking\n- Word presence\n- Topic coverage\n- Matching intent\n- Term frequency\n- Featured snippets\n- Content structure\n\nWe completed this over a 90-day sprint.\n\nWe hit 120K+ per month in 180 days.\n\nSoon after, we started publishing new content and quickly surpassed 150K+/mo SEO traffic.\n\nDo you want to turn SEO into a 7-figure sales channel?\n\nLet’s talk: https://hubs.ly/Q02yV2hb0",

𝗗𝘂𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁: Having the same or very similar content on multiple pages can negatively impact SEO.\n\n2 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀: Links that lead nowhere or to error pages create a bad user experience and can harm SEO.\n\n3. 𝗦𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀: Slow-loading pages can frustrate users and negatively affect search rankings.\n \n4. 𝗢𝗹𝗱 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀: Avoid older dates showing up against recently published or updated content. This hurts your CTR and your rankings\n\n5. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁: Pages with very little useful content are often ranked lower by search engines.\n\n6. 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗹𝘁 𝗧𝗮𝗴𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀: Images without alt tags or broken images can affect SEO as they contribute to the overall content quality and accessibility.\n\n7. 𝗨𝗻𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲𝘀: Titles and descriptions that are not optimized for keywords and readability can impact click-through rates and rankings.\n \n8. . 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗧𝗮𝗴𝘀: Not using header tags (H1, H2, etc.) correctly can make it harder for search engines to understand the structure and content of a page.\n \n9. 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀: Not having enough high-quality backlinks can affect a site's authority and ranking.\n \n10. 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗿 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝗨𝗫): Websites that are difficult to navigate or unengaging can lead to high bounce rates, which can negatively impact SEO.\n \n11. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 (𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗴): Excessively using keywords can lead to penalties from search engines for spammy behavior.\n \n12. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 (𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝘂𝗽): Failing to implement structured data can result in missed opportunities to enhance search result listings and improve click-through rates.\n\n 13. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗡𝗔𝗣 (𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲, 𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀, 𝗣𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗡𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿) 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗘𝗢: Inconsistencies in business listings can harm local SEO efforts.\n\n14. 𝗜𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘀: While not a direct ranking factor, social signals (like shares and likes) can indirectly affect SEO by increasing visibility and traffic.\n\n15. 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀: Every image uploaded may have its own page, which Google indexes. Plugins like Yoast can redirect attachment URLs to the image, maintaining a clean site footprint.\n\n16. 𝗛𝗧𝗧𝗣 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀: Ensure all pages are secure (HTTPS). Use the ‘site:domain inurl:-https’ search command to find non-secure pages.\n\n17. 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀: Perform a site:domain search with terms like “Lorem ipsum,” “Portfolio,” “Demo,” “Index,” “Error,” “Test,” or a blank search to find and address low-quality pages.\n\n📌Apply to work with us here: https://hubs.ly/Q02K2lgq0",

Builds your site's authority in the eyes of Google\n\n2. Drives top-of-funnel traffic which provides other benefits (i.e. email capture) and helps you rank for other more competitive, bottom-of-funnel keywords.\n\nWe still use a team of human writers and editors. Our strategy is using AI content for Top-of-Funnel traffic and human-written content with conversion-focused copy and keywords for bottom-of-funnel and for this client it’s been working wonders.\n\nWant to implement an AI driven TOFU strategy? Here’s how:\n\n1. 𝐁𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐤𝐞𝐲𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬\n\nFor example:\n\n→ {xyz} Ideas\n→ What is {Term}\n→ What is {Term} Difference\n→ How to {Do Thing} in {Tool}\n→ {Term} vs {Term} Difference\n\n2.

      "text": "Want to scale your sales channels to 7-figures with SEO Content?\n\nStart by following these 7 Best Practices:\n\n𝟏. 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐡𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭!\nYes we are writing for Google and other search engines, but at the end of the day our readers are humans and not robots. Try to make your writing fun and engaging first and then apply SEO rules.\n\n𝟐. 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐤𝐞𝐲𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭.\nCombine the main keyword with its Alts. These will be detailed in the article's Asana task. If not, try to come up with a few yourself. Use SEO tools like Google Ads, SEMRush, and even simple on-site search bars to identify broad search intent and your main keywords. IMPORTANT: focus on readability rather than keyword density. Try to get your KWs in the text smoothly. Don't sound repetitive!\n\n𝟑. 𝐊𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐬 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭!\nOver 85% of our readers access Herb on a mobile device. If they see a very long paragraph, they will probably get bored and leave the page. Try to keep your paragrpahs to a few lines. \n\n𝐓𝐈𝐏: when uploading an article to WordPress, a good rule of thumb is to keep them between 3-5 lines long.\n\n𝟒. 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐬!If you have to write a Review for a product, Google it and read the first articles that show up. See the words they use in the text and especially in the headings.\n\n𝟓. 𝐓𝐫𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐝𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐬 𝐢𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐬𝐞𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲.\n\n𝟔. 𝐈𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮'𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐎𝐟, 𝐬𝐞𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐤𝐞𝐲𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞! If you're writing an article and the competitor that ranks #1 for that keyword has 10 products, your article should have at least one more. Try to use concrete numbers (5,10, 15, etc) rather than irregular ones (13, 17, etc)\n\n\n𝟕. 𝐍𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐑 𝐚𝐝𝐝 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐫 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐬𝐥𝐮𝐠 (unless it’s the name of a brand/product) and DO NOT change slugs of existing articles.\n\n𝐏𝐑𝐎 𝐓𝐈𝐏: when it comes to slugs and URLs, the best thing to do is to limit yourself to the main keword of the article.\n𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐓: Make sure to add the words of the main keyword to the slug.\n\nIf it’s a best of article, make sure to add the words “best” to the slug.\nIf it’s a review article, make sure to add the word “review” to the slug.\nIf it’s a “what is…” article, make sure to add the words “what is” to the slug.\n\n📌Apply to work with us here:  https://hubs.ly/Q02yV2hb0",

      "text": "What makes a perfect blog post?\n\nIt's a blend of art, science, and a solid SEO strategy.\n\nHere's a clear checklist of the Anatomy of a Perfect Blog:\n\n✔️ SEO Metadata:\n\n- Title: Craft a compelling title with your target keywords. Though not a direct ranking factor, it's bolded in search results and should include a call-to-action (CTA).\n- \n- Description: Write a descriptive meta that entices clicks, similar to a well-crafted ad.\n- \n- URL: Ensure it matches your target keywords. Avoid duplicate page structures and refrain from including years in URLs.\n\n✔️ Schema Markup:\n\nImplement schema types like Article, BlogPosting, and Breadcrumbs for enhanced SERP presentation.\n\n✔️ Original Images:\n\nEvery image should have an Alt attribute for SEO and accessibility.\n\n✔️ Content-Length:\n\nAim for a minimum of 700 words, adjusting based on competition and query specificity.\n\n✔️ Table of Contents with Jump Links:\n\nUtilize anchor links for easy navigation. Google indexes these, enhancing user experience (UX) and providing valuable data.\n\n✔️ Heading Structure:\n\nFollow a proper format with a single H1 and supporting text under each heading. Use H3s and H4s appropriately.\n\n✔️ Internal Links:\n\nEnsure every page has internal links leading to and from it. This aids in crawl efficiency and contextual relevance.\n\n✔️ Product Card Embeds:\n\nEmbed product cards to increase CTR. Test different CTAs, especially for high-traffic articles.\n\n✔️ HTML Elements:\n\nUse lists, tables, and accordions to capture featured snippets and improve UX metrics like session duration.\n\n✔️ YouTube Video Embed:\n\nIdeally, pair each blog post with a complementary YouTube video. Embedding videos can serve as backlinks and enhance visibility on both Google and YouTube.\n\n✔️ CTA for Engagement:\n\nEncourage user engagement with clear CTAs. This can lead to better interaction metrics and conversions.\n\n\nCheck each one of these points when creating your blog posts and you'll not just be writing content; you'll be crafting an experience that resonates with your readers and search engines alike.\n\n📌 Want our help creating top-tier SEO content for your brand?

      "text": "What makes a site rank?\n\nMajor ranking factors can be summed up into these 3 categories:\n\n1. Age – how old the website is, the age of the URL in the index, when the content was published, etc – the only thing that can’t be gamed.\n\n\n2. Focus – how laser focused the content is on the page to the target search term.  Not just written content, but also videos, images, code, etc.  This is on-page SEO.\n\nBy optimizing your content to match the target keywords, Google will reward the page and rank it higher.\n\n- The Title Tag carries the most ranking weight on the page, and the focus keyword must be included.\n\n- The meta description technically has no ranking value, but including keywords here is crucial as Google will bold words from the query which helps increase click through rate.\n\n- The headings on the page also carry a lot of ranking value, so it’s important to include long tail variations or related keywords in your subheadings.\n\n\n3. Trust – the authority of the domain name based on backlinks and the individual page’s link profile strength.  This is off-page SEO.\n\nBuilding backlinks solely for the purpose of ranking is actually against Google’s terms of service they have set out.\n\nIn today’s algorithm it is usually best to generate links naturally by creating great content that other websites will link to as a reference.\n\nThere are also other methods to help increase the chance of acquiring links, like creating embeddable videos for other websites to add to their pages, or by sponsoring events and organizations that link back to their donors.\n\nUnderstanding and optimizing for these three core ranking factors—Age, Focus, and Trust—can significantly enhance your website's search engine rankings. Keep these principles in mind, and you'll pave the way for improved visibility and organic traffic growth.\n\n📌Apply to work with us here: https://hubs.ly/Q02xzlTD0",

      "text": "You don’t need “link building” trickery to rank in Google. \n\nInstead, you can go from 0 to 100k+ monthly views just by posting perfectly optimized blog posts 3x per week.\n\nBut what is a “perfectly optimized” post?\n\nIt's a blend of art and science.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n––––\n\n✔️ SEO Metadata \n\nTreat it like an ad or social post—it must be compelling to get people to click.\n\n• Title: Write a compelling hook with your target keywords. \n•  Description: Treat it like ad copy, hook their interest so they click.\n•  URL: Match your target keywords.\n\n\n✔️Schema markup\n\n•  Implement schema types like Article, BlogPosting, and Breadcrumbs so your content displays on the SERP. \n\nIf yours doesn’t, someone else’s will.\n\n\n✔️ Original images\n\n•  Add alt tags to every image for SEO visibility and accessibility. Describe the key elements as if someone can’t see them.\n•  Break up large chunks of text with visuals.\n•  Stock photos, no thank you.\n\n\n✔️ Content length:\n\n• Aim for a minimum of 700 words, adjusting based on:\n\n1. Competition: \nIf competitors are at 1,000 words, make a more thorough article that’s 1,500+ words.\n\n2. Query specificity: \n•  Super specific keyword = short article. \n• Broad keyword = extensive article.\n\n\n✔️ Table of contents with anchor links:\n\n•  For longer articles (1,000+ words) add a table of contents to make it easy to jump to what they care about.\n\n\n✔️ Heading structure:\n\n• Use only one H1—the title of the article, ideally with the target keyword.\n• Add supporting text under each heading to add context.\n• Use H2s, H3s, and H4s appropriately.\n• Make headings compelling. You have to keep them interested.\n\n\n✔️ Internal links:\n\nInternal links are essential. SEO experts say they’re more important than backlinks.\n\n• Ensure every page has internal links leading to and from it. \n• If you have a long article targeting a high-level keyword ( ), each section could link to another dedicated blog article \n•  Aim for posts to have 7+ internal links by cross-linking related articles.\n\n\n✔️ HTML elements:\n\n• Use lists, tables, and accordions to capture featured snippets. \n\nIt makes the article more delightful for readers so they stay longer.\n\n\n✔️ YouTube embed:\n\n•  Pair each post with a YouTube video. Embedding videos act as backlinks and enhance visibility on Google and YouTube.\n\nShopify grew its YouTube to 230k subscribers in 18 months with this strategy.\n\n\n✔️ Clear, compelling CTA \n\n• Include clear CTAs throughout the article to turn readers into leads. \n• Add contextually relevant lead magnets (email courses/PDFs) to each article.\n\n–––\n\nThanks to Rob Hoffman and Jake Ward for their help with this one.\n\nWe've also created 4 blog post templates that have driven millions in organic traffic.

We’re offering a limited-time deal for just $500.\n\n📌 Click here to claim yours now: https://lnkd.in/e57fNwpd  \n\n(Heads up: this price will slowly increase over time to $1,000+)\n\nIn the meantime, here's a clear checklist of the Anatomy of a Perfect Blog:\n\n✔️ SEO Metadata:\n\n- Title: Craft a compelling title with your target keywords. Though not a direct ranking factor, it's bolded in search results and should include a call-to-action (CTA).\n\n- Description: Write a descriptive meta that entices clicks, similar to a well-crafted ad.\n\n- URL: Ensure it matches your target keywords. Avoid duplicate page structures and refrain from including years in URLs.\n\n✔️ Schema Markup:\n\nImplement schema types like Article, BlogPosting, and Breadcrumbs for enhanced SERP presentation.\n\n✔️ Original Images:\n\nEvery image should have an Alt attribute for SEO and accessibility.\n\n✔️ Content-Length:\n\nAim for a minimum of 700 words, adjusting based on competition and query specificity.\n\n✔️ Table of Contents with Jump Links:\n\nUtilize anchor links for easy navigation. Google indexes these, enhancing user experience (UX) and providing valuable data.\n\n✔️ Heading Structure:\n\nFollow a proper format with a single H1 and supporting text under each heading. Use H3s and H4s appropriately.\n\n✔️ Internal Links:\n\nEnsure every page has internal links leading to and from it. This aids in crawl efficiency and contextual relevance.\n\n✔️ Product Card Embeds:\n\nEmbed product cards to increase CTR. Test different CTAs, especially for high-traffic articles.\n\n✔️ HTML Elements:\n\nUse lists, tables, and accordions to capture featured snippets and improve UX metrics like session duration.\n\n✔️ YouTube Video Embed:\n\nIdeally, pair each blog post with a complementary YouTube video. Embedding videos can serve as backlinks and enhance visibility on both Google and YouTube.\n\n✔️ CTA for Engagement:\n\nEncourage user engagement with clear CTAs. This can lead to better interaction metrics and conversions.\n\nCheck each one of these points when creating your blog posts and you'll not just be writing content; you'll be crafting an experience that resonates with your readers and search engines alike.",

      "text": "SEO pros use complicated words to trick you into thinking it’s hard. \n\nIn reality, SEO is simple… \n\nHere’s how it works: \n\nFor starters, why choose SEO over other marketing channels? \n\nSEO is the only channel that lets you get in front of your ideal customers at the exact moment they’re searching for your product or solution. \n\nThis is why SEO is one of the top 2 highest ROI marketing channels on the planet. \n\nTo do this, you need to publish content on your website that perfectly matches what your customers are searching on Google. \n\nThese search terms are called “keywords.” \n\nTo find the best keywords, use SEO tools like SEMRush or Ahrefs. \n\nKeyword research is a lot of trial and error: thinking of potential keywords your ideal customers might search, and looking them up on your SEO tools.\n\nThe best keywords fit 3 simple criteria: \n\n1. Are enough people searching for this keyword? \n2. Can I successfully compete for this keyword? \n3. Does this keyword have “buying intent” behind it? \n\nIf the answer to these 3 questions is “yes,” write a piece of content about that keyword. \n\nThe keywords with the highest number of searches, lowest competition, and highest “buying intent” are your Primary Keywords. \n\nPrimary Keywords = the title of your article.\n\nOther related keywords that also fit those 3 criteria, but to a slightly lesser extent, are your Secondary Keywords. \n\nSecondary Keywords = the H2 subheadings of your article. \n\nBefore you write your article, take a look at what other articles are already ranking for your Primary Keyword. \n\nAsk yourself: \n1. How long are the top-ranking articles?\n2. What H2 and H3 subheadings are they including? \n3. What parts of their content are unclear or lack key information?\n4. What images, videos, or infographics are they using in their articles?\n\nNow your job is simple: make your article better than the others. \n\nRinse and repeat as many times as you can. \n\nObviously, there are many nuances that I’m not covering here. \n\nTechnical SEO and building a strong Trust Flow score are also important. \n\nBut get the content right, and you’re 80% of the way there. \n\nGood luck out there!",

      "text": "Most businesses make 1 major mistake that can permanently damage their site’s SEO👇 \n\nThey make major changes to their website without consulting with an SEO, and accidentally wreak havoc on their website’s traffic.\n\nThis commonly happens with “site migrations” \n\nWe’ve seen businesses lose up to 90% of their organic traffic in a single day, thanks to this mistake.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because the developers who make structural changes to your website know nothing about SEO.\n\nAs a result, they miss key SEO best practices such as:\n\n1. Implementing redirects\n2. Updating URLs to avoid 301 errors for internal and menu links. \n3. Maintaining the URL structures exactly the same as they were pre-migration\n\nAs a result, your website loses all of the “backlink juice” as well as the page indexing and age you’ve spent the last several years building.\n\nLuckily, the solution to this problem is easy: always have an experienced SEO oversee major website changes like migrations.\n\nWhen our clients make major changes to their website, like migrating from Wordpress to Shopify for example, we help them every step of the way.\n\nSince we onboard all of our clients onto Slack, we can easily work closely with their developers to make sure migrations go smoothly.\n\nRemember: if website traffic is important to you, you should always have an SEO on-call.\n\nLooking for help growing your website’s traffic and creating a reliable pipeline of new customers?\n\n📌Book a call today.
