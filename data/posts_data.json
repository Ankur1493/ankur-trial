      "text": "Google's leaked documents confirmed it.\n\nThey use a secret metric called siteAuthority to determine who to trust.\n\nThe sites dominating search in 2025 and beyond aren't chasing keywords. They're owning entire topics.\n\n7-step framework for building topical authority:\n\n1. Define your core topic domain\n\nPick a niche you can actually dominate. \"Email marketing\" is too broad. \"Email marketing for SaaS companies\" works. Most people fail here by going too wide.\n\n2. Uncover your entire topic universe\n\nMap every subtopic and user question. Use Reddit, Quora, People Also Ask, competitor analysis. You need 1,000s of keywords, not 20.\n\n3. Group keywords into content clusters\n\nUse SERP-based clustering. If two keywords show 70%+ overlap in top-ranking URLs, they belong on the same page. Pattern-based tools miss this completely.\n\nTool tip: I cluster keywords with Keyword Insights.\n\n4. Architect topic hubs\n\nCreate pillar pages for broad topics. Build cluster pages for specific subtopics. Internally link them both ways. This signals comprehensive coverage to Google.\n\n5. Execute content gap analysis\n\nFind every cluster where competitors rank, but you don't. Prioritize by search volume and difficulty. These are your highest-ROI opportunities.\n\n6. Create content with information gain\n\nAdd unique value. Original research, firsthand experience, expert analysis. AI 'consensus' content doesn't tend to build authority.\n\n7. Weave strategic internal links\n\nHub-and-spoke model. Every cluster links to its pillar. Every pillar links to all clusters. No page should be orphaned (left on its own).\n\nSites that master this see 57% faster traffic growth than those that don't (Graphite, 2024).\n\nThe question isn't whether to build topical authority.\n\nIt's whether you'll build it before your competitors do.",

      "text": "I just went on Greg Isenberg's podcast and broke down 6 proven playbooks that took bootstrapped SaaS from $0 to $300K MRR.\n\nReal examples.\nReal numbers.\nReal tactics you can copy.\n\nHere's how to get customers for your SaaS in 2026:\n\n(PS. Watch the podcast here: https://lnkd.in/e-CjhaAz)\n\nThe companies we're reverse engineering:\n\n- Kleo: $61K MRR\n- TrustMRR: $24K MRR (in 30 days)\n- Teachizy: $65K MRR\n- Tally: $338K MRR\n- LocalRank: $47K MRR\n- Mailscale: $100K+ MRR\n\nPlaybook 1: The Waitlist Strategy\n\nWe used this for Kleo. Hit $61K MRR in 53 days.\n\nThe framework: Content → Email → Webinar\n\nCreate \"edusales\" content that subtly teases your product. Don't hard sell. Lead with value. Plug your tool in ONE bullet point.\n\nLaunch beta to your waitlist with early-bird lifetime discount.\n\nWe offered the first 500 users lifetime access for $59 (normally $99).\n\nThis creates scarcity and FOMO.\n\nHit $61K MRR before even launching publicly.\n\nStack your calendar with customer calls. Use first 500 users to iterate. Then relaunch to second cohort at a higher price.\n\nPlaybook 2: The Wave Surfer Strategy\n\nTrustMR by Marc Lou: $24K MRR in 30 days.\n\nPieter Levels tweeted, complaining about fake MRR screenshots on X.\n\nMarc shipped TrustMRR within 48 hours.\n\nHe didn't use his own audience. He piggybacked on Pieter’s virality.\n\nShip fast. Quit fast if it doesn't work.\n\nBuild virality into the product. TrustMRR is inherently shareable.\n\nWhen you get massive attention but low intent, sell ads instead of subscriptions.\n\nPlaybook 3: Language Arbitrage Strategy\n\nTeachizy: $65K MRR\n\nThey took Kajabi/Teachable and made it 100% French.\n\nThat's it. Same product. Different language.\n\nSEO in other languages = marketing on easy mode. High volume. Low competition. It's what SEO in English looked like in the early 2000s.\n\nPlaybook 4: AI Search Strategy\n\nTally: $338K MRR\n\nThey became the #1 recommended form builder in ChatGPT.\n\nResult: 2,000+ new users from AI search in 2025 alone.\n\nCreated comprehensive alternatives pages and \"best of\" articles. When people search \"Typeform alternative\" in ChatGPT, Tally shows up first.\n\nTraffic from ChatGPT converts 4-5x better than Google. In some cases, 17x better.\n\nWhy? People trust ChatGPT like a friend.\n\nPlus ChatGPT gives 2-3 recommendations vs 1,000 blue links.\n\nThe next 6 months are the biggest window to take advantage of this.\n\nPlaybook 5: Signal Search Strategy\n\nLocalRank: $47K MRR. Made $5K MRR on day one.\n\nThey shipped ONE feature (a heat map) to test market response.\n\nThis let them validate demand before investing months into a full platform.\n\nThey launched it on YouTube and X (YouTube drove 80% of signups)\n\nOops, I've run out of characters.\n\nCheck out Playbook 6: High Ticket Ad Strategy (Mailscale: $100K MRR) in the comments 👇\n\nI spent 8 hours researching these SaaS strategies so you don't have to...\n\nWhich playbook do you like best?",

Convert (Top of Pyramid)\n\nHigh-intent content for people ready to buy.\n\nA. Competitor Comparisons\n↳ \"beehiiv vs Kit\"\n↳ \"Kit alternatives\"\n\nB. Product Reviews\n↳ \"beehiiv reviews\" (brand)\n↳ \"Kit review\" (competitor)\n\nC. Buyer Guides\n↳ \"Best newsletter platforms in 2025\"\n↳ \"Best newsletter tools for beginners\"\n\nD. Product Pages\n↳ \"Email newsletter software\"\n↳ \"Newsletter platform pricing\"\n\n2. Discover (Middle of Pyramid)\n\nSolution content for people exploring options.\n\nA. Solve Pain Points\n↳ \"How to start a newsletter\"\n↳ \"Newsletter best practices\"\n\nB. Case Studies\n↳ \"Email marketing case studies\"\n↳ \"How [Brand] grew to 100k subscribers\"\n\nC. Data Studies\n↳ \"Open rate benchmarks 2025\"\n↳ \"Email marketing statistics\"\n\nD. Templates and Tools\n↳ \"Newsletter templates\"\n↳ \"Email subject line generator\"\n\n3. Awareness (Bottom of Pyramid)\n\nEducational content for people learning and exploring.\n\nA. Definitions\n↳ \"What is open rate\"\n↳ \"Email deliverability explained\"\n\nB.

      "text": "How I rank businesses inside LLMs:\n\nAI platforms handle millions of daily queries, Google now shows AI summaries on 1 in 5 searches, Google is making AI Mode the default.\n\nThis isn't just another SEO hype.\n\nBut successful AI SEO follows 7 key steps that most people completely miss.\n\nHere’s my AI SEO playbook:\n\nStep 1: Map your customer questions\n\nWrite down every question from your sales calls. Those same questions are being asked in ChatGPT right now.\n\nBut don't stop there. Map the follow-up questions too. LLMs love comprehensive answers.\n\nStep 2: Create answer-focused pages\n\nBuild pages that directly answer those questions. Skip the fluff and get straight to solutions.\n\nStep 3: Get authentic forum mentions\n\nMake a real account on forums like Reddit. Use your real name and company. Give genuinely helpful answers in relevant threads.\n\nAnswer long-tail questions others ignore. These feed directly into LLM responses.\n\nBut don't spam. Communities spot fake accounts instantly.\n\nStep 4: Publish YouTube videos\n\nTarget specific problems your customers face. LLMs love video citations for complex topics.\n\nFocus on topics where written content falls short.\n\nStep 5: Build strategic affiliate partnerships\n\nPartner with creators who naturally mention your solutions. Authentic recommendations carry more weight than ads.\n\nStep 6: Maximise quality citations everywhere\n\nGet mentioned in blog posts, forums, podcasts. More citations equal more LLM visibility.\n\nQuality beats quantity. One mention in a trusted source outperforms ten low-quality ones.\n\nStep 7: Track your brand mentions religiously\n\nUse a tool like Mentions to monitor when and how your brand (and each competitor) appears.\n\nThe AI revolution isn't killing SEO. It's creating new opportunities for companies willing to adapt.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nEven early-stage companies can win immediately.\n\nYou don't need domain authority like Google. You just need to get cited and you’ll start showing up.",

      "text": "How does AI search actually work today?\n\nThis is what happens between ask and answer:\n\nUnlike older models that leaned on recall, GPT-5 grounds answers in live sources with a search-and-verify loop.\n\n1. Your Question\n\nUses chat history and general location for relevance.\n\n2. Decide to Search\n\nIf the model needs fresh, verifiable, or comparative info, it turns on search.\n\n3. Plan Search\n\nBreaks your ask into sub-queries, chooses a provider, sets recency or domain limits.\n\n4A. Web Retrieval\n\nHits a search index with keywords and vectors, re-ranks for relevance, freshness, and diversity, and returns candidate URLs/snippets.\n\n4B–F. Where that index comes from\n\n- Websites: Public pages and feeds\n- Collect Pages: Crawlers/APIs fetch, follow robots.txt\n- Clean & Split: Strip boilerplate; chunk with metadata\n- Index for Search: Make embeddings; add entities/links\n- Search Index: Searchable store for keyword and vector\n\n5. Open Pages\n\nFetches the chosen URLs, renders HTML, follows redirects, normalizes canonicals.\n\n6. Evidence\n\nPulls clean, cited snippets with dates and URLs; filters out duplicates.\n\n7. Write Answer\n\nComposes from the evidence; can add steps, tables, comparisons, citations.\n\n8. Quality Check\n\nGroundedness and policy screens; flags conflicting claims across sources.\n\n9. Answer\n\nFinal explanation with sources and follow-ups. Clicks and re-asks feed a small feedback loop for better routing next time.\n\nCurious to know how you show up in AI answers?\n\nUse Mentions.",

      "text": "I’m seeing tons of misleading SEO advice for AI search.\n\nLet’s bust 5 of the biggest myths:\n\n1. “You need to write in a special way for LLMs to understand you”\n\nLLMs are trained on billions of examples of natural language: conversations, books, web pages, social media. They learn patterns, context, and slang the way people actually write.\n\nThat makes them robust to typos, casual grammar, and everyday phrasing. In other words: they’re built to process normal human language, not rigid SEO-style writing.\n\n2. “Adding an llms.txt file will improve visibility in AI search results”\n\nllms.txt is not a ranking factor. It’s a proposed standard for telling AI models what they can or can’t use, but most don’t even honor it.\n\nPublishing one doesn’t boost how often you show up in AI answers, visibility comes from shaping your brand narrative across sites, communities, and trusted sources, not from a text file.\n\n3. “AI will reliably use schema markup to generate answers”\n\nSchema is intended as a hint, not a guarantee. Most LLMs don’t consistently parse schema, often ignore it when conflicting content exists, or give higher weight to context from non-schema sources.\n\nPresence of schema does not assure inclusion in generated answers.\n\n4. “LLMs just pulls from the first page of Google results”\n\nAI answers don’t simply mirror the SERP. Yes, there’s overlap with the top 10 results, but it varies a lot:\n\n- Perplexity: 82% overlap\n- Google AI Mode: 35% overlap\n- ChatGPT: 28% overlap\n\nAnd beyond SERPs, 40% of AI answers come from Reddit and other community-driven sources. Meaning: ranking on page one isn’t enough, visibility in AI requires presence across forums, news, and niche sites too.\n\n5. “You need special tactics to win spots in AI Overviews”\n\nGoogle has been clear that there isn’t a hidden trick. AI Overviews rely on the same fundamentals as organic search: high-quality, relevant, authoritative content.\n\nIf your pages already perform well in traditional search, they’re eligible to be surfaced in AI Overviews. What matters is clarity, expertise, and trustworthiness, not special tactics or gimmicks.\n\nDid I miss any big myths you’ve seen?",

You can make it [really] GOOD later.\"\n\nWe could've waited another 30 days to make it \"perfect.\" But perfection doesn't exist. Feedback does.\n\nSo we're shipping it today.\n\n500 beta spots. First come, first serve. Then we close (again).\n\nJake Ward, Lara Acosta, Cameron Trew and I have spent months rebuilding Kleo from the ground up. Late nights. Brutal feedback. Scrapping features.\n\nFor context: The new Kleo is a writing workflow tool for LinkedIn. It helps you go from idea to published post in minutes.\n\nThis isn't a minor update.\n\nWe rewrote the entire core. It now handles everything from brainstorming ideas to writing with your knowledge to maintaining your voice.\n\nSome early reactions:\n\n\"You actually listened\"\n\"This is what I needed from day one\"\n\"This changes everything for my workflow\"\n\nWe're only letting 500 people in this first wave. We want to work closely with this group. Your feedback will shape what Kleo becomes for the next 100,000 users.\n\nA few hours from now, the link is going live to the waitlist. First 500 get access. Everyone else stays on the waitlist.\n\nI'll drop the waitlist link in the comments.\n\nLet's build something incredible together.",
